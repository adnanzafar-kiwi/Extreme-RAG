drugs\n\n\n\nPharmacokinetics is the quantitative study of drug movement in, through and out of the body. The overall scheme of pharmacokinetic processes is depicted in Fig. 2.1. The intensity of response is related to concentration of the drug at the site of action, which in turn is dependent on its pharmacokinetic properties. Pharmacokinetic considerations, therefore, determine the route(s) of administration, dose, latency of onset, time of peak action, duration of action and frequency of administration of a drug.\n\nAll pharmacokinetic processes involve transport of the drug across biological membranes.\n\nBiological membrane This is a bilayer (about 100 \u00c5 thick) of phospholipid and cholesterol molecules, the polar groups (glyceryl phosphate attached to ethanolamine/choline or hydroxyl group of cholesterol) of these are oriented at the two surfaces and the nonpolar hydrocarbon chains are embedded in the matrix to form a continuous sheet. This imparts high electrical resistance and relative impermeability to the membrane. Extrinsic and intrinsic protein molecules are adsorbed on the lipid bilayer (Fig. 2.2). Glycoproteins or glycolipids are formed on the surface by attachment to polymeric sugars, aminosugars\u00a0\u00a0 or sialic acids. The specific lipid and protein composition of different membranes differs according to the cell or the organelle type. The proteins are able to freely float through the membrane: associate and organize or vice versa. Some of the intrinsic ones, which extend through the full thickness of the membrane, surround fine aqueous pores. Paracellular spaces or channels also exist between certain epithelial/endothelial cells. Other adsorbed proteins have enzymatic, carrier, receptor or signal transduction properties. Lipid molecules also are capable of lateral movement. Thus, biological membranes are highly dynamic structures.\n\nDrugs are transported across the membranes by:\n\n(a) Passive diffusion and filtration\n\n(b) Specialized transport\n\nPassive diffusion\n\nThe drug diffuses across the membrane in the direction of its concentration gradient (high to low), the membrane playing no active role in the process. This is the most important mechanism for majority of drugs; drugs are foreign substances\u00a0 (xenobiotics), and specialized mechanisms are developed by the body primarily for normal metabolites.\n\nLipid soluble drugs diffuse by dissolving in the lipoidal matrix of the membrane (Fig. 2.3), the rate of transport being proportional to the lipid : water partition coefficient of the drug. A more lipid-soluble drug attains higher concentration in the membrane and diffuses quickly. Also, greater the difference in the concentration of the drug on the two sides of the membrane, faster is its diffusion.\n\nInfluence of pH Most drugs are weak electrolytes, i.e. their ionization is pH dependent (contrast strong electrolytes that are nearly completely ionized at acidic as well as alkaline pH). The ionization of a weak acid HA is given by the equation:\n\n \n\npKa is the negative logarithm of acidic dissociation constant of the weak electrolyte. If the concentration of ionized drug [A\u00af\u00a0] is equal to concentration of unionized drug [HA], then\n\n \n\nsince log 1 is 0, under this condition \n\npH = pKa...(2)\n\nThus, pKa is numerically equal to the pH at which the drug is 50% ionized.\n\nIf pH is increased by 1 scale, then\u2014\n\nlog [A\u00af\u00a0]/[HA] = 1\u00a0 or\u00a0 [A\u00af\u00a0]/[HA] = 10\n\nSimilarly, if pH is reduced by 1 scale, then\u2014\n\n[A\u00af\u00a0]/[HA] = 1/10\n\nThus, weakly acidic drugs, which form salts with cations, e.g. sod. phenobarbitone, sod. sulfadiazine, pot. penicillin-V, etc. ionize more at alkaline pH and 1 scale change in pH causes 10 fold change in ionization.\n\nWeakly basic drugs, which form salts with anions, e.g. atropine sulfate, ephedrine HCl, chloroquine phosphate, etc. conversely ionize more at acidic pH. Ions being lipid insoluble, do not diffuse and a pH difference across a membrane can cause differential distribution of weakly acidic and weakly basic drugs on the two sides (Fig. 2.4).\n\n\n\nImplications of this consideration are:\n\n(a) Acidic drugs, e.g. aspirin (pKa 3.5) are largely unionized at acid gastric pH and are absorbed from stomach, while bases, e.g. atropine (pKa 10) are largely ionized and are absorbed only when they reach the intestines.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4369, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a6905a8f-e3df-411d-bc57-4d956713999e": {"__data__": {"id_": "a6905a8f-e3df-411d-bc57-4d956713999e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_2.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_2.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 19964, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6ba9ae5b-7378-4e65-9fff-808263e12d71", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_2.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_2.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 19964, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "7e10fbfe9fe613586d51118017d0e49aa9d5658ae1d921cc2ce8476a1b46fef3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "be841e7f-8125-4d31-87b8-366afe3e4db7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_2.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_2.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 19964, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "ed492f9697f6d76b8bce284fafde2c3bafd845a8e645a68c3d4aa8dcacd4dedb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ff6673f2-08cf-43f3-bb3c-c710da472b0b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6e98418c34dd6554e36b164cbfc2abb3881955bb200e9a6b532ba83c7c58b3e6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Implications of this consideration are:\n\n(a) Acidic drugs, e.g. aspirin (pKa 3.5) are largely unionized at acid gastric pH and are absorbed from stomach, while bases, e.g. atropine (pKa 10) are largely ionized and are absorbed only when they reach the intestines.\n\n(b) The unionized form of acidic drugs which crosses the surface membrane of gastric mucosal cell, reverts to the ionized form within the cell (pH 7.0) and then only slowly passes to the extracellular fluid. This is called ion trapping, i.e. a weak electrolyte crossing a membrane to encounter a pH from which it is not able to escape easily. This may contribute to gastric mucosal cell damage caused by aspirin.\n\n(c) Basic drugs attain higher concentration intracellularly (pH 7.0 vs 7.4 of plasma).\n\n(d) Acidic drugs are ionized more in alkaline urine\u2014do not back diffuse in the kidney tubules and are excreted faster. Accordingly, basic drugs are excreted faster if urine is acidified.\n\nLipid-soluble nonelectrolytes (e.g. ethanol, diethyl-ether) readily cross biological membranes and their transport is pH independent.\n\nFiltration\n\nFiltration is passage of drugs through aqueous pores in the membrane or through paracellular spaces. This can be accelerated if hydrodynamic flow of the solvent is occurring under hydrostatic or osmotic pressure gradient, e.g. across most capillaries including glomeruli. Lipid-insoluble drugs cross biological membranes by filtration if their molecular size is smaller than the diameter of the pores (Fig. 2.3). Majority of cells (intestinal mucosa, RBC, etc.) have very small pores (4 \u00c5) and drugs with MW > 100 or 200 are not able to penetrate. However, capillaries (except those in brain) have large paracellular spaces (40 \u00c5) and most drugs (even albumin) can filter through these (Fig. 2.8). As such, diffusion of drugs across capillaries is dependent on rate of blood flow through them rather than on lipid solubility of the drug or pH of the medium.\n\nSpecialized transport\n\nThis can be carrier mediated or by vesicular transport (endocytosis, exocytosis).\n\nCarrier transport \n\nAll cell membranes express a host of transmembrane proteins which serve as carriers or transporters for physiologically important ions, nutrients, metabolites, transmitters, etc. across the membrane. At some sites, certain transporters also translocate xenobiotics, including drugs and their metabolites. In contrast to channels, which open for a finite time and allow passage of specific ions, transporters combine transiently with their substrate (ion or organic compound)\u2014undergo a conformational change carrying the substrate to the other side of the membrane where the substrate dissociates and the transporter returns back to its original state (Fig. 2.5). Carrier transport is specific for the substrate (or the type of substrate, e.g. an organic anion), saturable, competitively inhibited by analogues which utilize the same transporter, and is much slower than the flux through channels. Depending on requirement of energy, carrier transport is of two types:\n\na. Facilitated diffusion The transporter, belonging to the super-family of solute carrier (SLC) transporters, operates passively without needing energy and translocates the substrate in the direction of its electrochemical gradient, i.e. from higher to lower concentration (Fig. 2.5A). It merely facilitates permeation of a poorly diffusible substrate, e.g. the entry of glucose into muscle and fat cells by the glucose transporter GLUT 4.\n\nb. Active transport It requires energy, is inhibited by metabolic poisons, and transports the solute against its electrochemical gradient (low to high), resulting in selective accumulation of the substance on one side of the membrane. Drugs related to normal metabolites can utilize the transport processes meant for these, e.g. levodopa and methyl dopa are actively absorbed from the gut by the aromatic amino acid transporter.

Active transport It requires energy, is inhibited by metabolic poisons, and transports the solute against its electrochemical gradient (low to high), resulting in selective accumulation of the substance on one side of the membrane. Drugs related to normal metabolites can utilize the transport processes meant for these, e.g. levodopa and methyl dopa are actively absorbed from the gut by the aromatic amino acid transporter. In addition, the body has developed some relatively nonselective transporters, like P-glycoprotein (P-gp), to deal with xenobiotics. Active transport can be primary or secondary depending on the source of the driving force.\n\ni. Primary active transport Energy is obtained directly by the hydrolysis of ATP (Fig. 2.5B). The transporters belong to the superfamily of ATP binding cassettee (ABC) transporters whose intracellular loops have ATPase activity. They mediate only efflux of the solute from the cytoplasm, either to extracellular fluid or into an intracellular organelli (endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, etc.)\n\nEncoded by the multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) gene, P-gp is the most well known primary active transporter expressed in the intestinal mucosa, renal tubules, bile canaliculi, choroidal epithelium, astrocyte foot processes around brain capillaries (the blood-brain barrier), testicular and placental microvessels, which pumps out many drugs/metabolites and thus limits their intestinal absorption, penetration into brain, testes and foetal tissues as well as promotes biliary and renal elimination. Many xenobiotics which induce or inhibit P-gp also have a similar effect on the drug metabolizing isoenzyme CYP3A4, indicating their synergistic role in detoxification of xenobiotics.\n\nOther primary active transporters of pharmacological significance are multidrug resistance associated protein 2 (MRP 2) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP).\n\nii. Secondary active transport In this type of active transport effected by another set of SLC transporters, the energy to pump one solute is derived from the downhill movement of another solute (mostly Na+). When the concentration gradients are such that both the solutes move in the same direction (Fig. 2.5C), it is called symport or cotransport, but when they move in opposite directions (Fig. 2.5D), it is termed antiport or exchange transport. Metabolic energy (from hydrolysis of ATP) is spent in maintaining high transmembrane electrochemical gradient of the second solute (generally Na+). The SLC transporters mediate both uptake and efflux of drugs and metabolites. \n\nThe organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) and organic cation transporter (OCT), highly expressed in liver canaliculi and renal tubules, are secondary active transporters important in the metabolism and excretion of drugs and metabolites (especially glucuronides). The Na+,Cl\u2013 dependent neurotransmitter transporters for norepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine (NET, SERT and DAT) are active SLC transporters that are targets for action of drugs like tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), cocaine, etc. Similarly, the Vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT-2) of adrenergic and serotonergic storage vesicles transports catecholamines and 5-HT into the vesicles by exchanging with H+ions, and is inhibited by reserpine. The absorption of glucose in intestines and renal tubules is through secondary active transport by sodium-glucose transporters (SGLT1 and SGLT2).\n\nAs indicated earlier, carrier transport (both facilitated diffusion and active transport) is saturable and follows the Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The maximal rate of transport is dependent on the density of the transporter in a particular membrane, and its rate constant (Km), i.e. the substrate concentration at which rate of transport is half maximal, is governed by its affinity for the substrate. Genetic polymorphism can alter both the density and affinity of the transporter protein for different substrates and thus affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs.

Moreover, tissue specific drug distribution can occur due to the presence of specific transporters in certain cells.\n\nVesicular transport (endocytosis, exocytosis)\n\nCertain substances with very large or impermeable molecules are transported inside the cell (endocytosis) or extruded from it (exocytosis) by enclosing their particles into tiny vesicles. A binding protein located on the membrane complexes with the substance and initiates vesicle formation (Fig. 2.6). The vesicle then detaches from the membrane and may remain stored within the cell, or it may release the substance in the cytoplasm, or it may move to the opposite membrane fuse with it to release the substance across the cell (exocytosis).\u00a0 \n\nVesicular transport is applicable to proteins and other big molecules, and contributes little to transport of most drugs, barring few like vit B12 which is absorbed from the gut after binding to intrinsic factor (a protein). Most hormones (insulin, etc.) and neurotransmitters, like noradrenaline, are secreted/released from the cell/nerve ending by exocytosis. Activation of the secretory cell/nerve ending prompts fusion of the storage vesicle to the surface membrane followed by extrusion of its contents into the extracellular space.\n\nABSORPTION\n\nAbsorption is movement of the drug from its site of administration into the circulation. Not only the fraction of the administered dose that gets absorbed, but also the rate of absorption is important. Except when given i.v., the drug has to cross biological membranes; absorption is governed by the above described principles. Other factors affecting absorption are:\n\nAqueous solubility Drugs given in solid form must dissolve in the aqueous biophase before they are absorbed. For poorly water soluble drugs (aspirin, griseofulvin) rate of dissolution governs rate of absorption. Ketoconazole dissolves at low pH: gastric acid is needed for its absorption. Obviously, a drug given as watery solution is absorbed faster than when the same is given in solid form or as oily solution.\n\nConcentration Passive diffusion depends on concentration gradient; drug given as concentrated solution is absorbed faster than from dilute solution.\n\nArea of absorbing surface Larger is the surface area, faster is the absorption.\n\nVascularity of the absorbing surface Blood circulation removes the drug from the site of absorption and maintains the concentration gradient across the absorbing surface. Increased blood flow hastens drug absorption just as wind hastens drying of clothes.\n\nRoute of administration This affects drug absorption, because each route has its own peculiarities.\n\nOral\n\nThe effective barrier to orally administered drugs is the epithelial lining of the gastrointestinal tract, which is lipoidal. Nonionized lipid soluble drugs, e.g. ethanol are readily absorbed from stomach as well as intestine at rates proportional to their lipid : water partition coefficient. Acidic drugs, e.g. salicylates, barbiturates, etc. are predominantly unionized in the acid gastric juice and are absorbed from stomach, while basic drugs, e.g. morphine, quinine, etc. are largely ionized and are absorbed only on reaching the duodenum. However, even for acidic drugs absorption from stomach is slower, because the mucosa is thick, covered with mucus and the surface area is small. Absorbing surface area is much larger in the small intestine due to villi. Thus, faster gastric emptying accelerates drug absorption in general. Dissolution is a surface phenomenon, therefore, particle size of the drug in solid dosage form governs rate of dissolution and in turn rate of absorption.\n\nPresence of food dilutes the drug and retards absorption. Further, certain drugs form poorly absorbed complexes with food constituents, e.g. tetracyclines with calcium present in milk; moreover food delays gastric emptying. Thus, most drugs are absorbed better if taken in empty stomach. However, there are some exceptions, e.g. fatty food greatly enhances lumefantrine absorption.", "start_char_idx": 10943, "end_char_idx": 15666, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "83d6ae8b-b5b6-430a-b3a4-d9b536323af4": {"__data__": {"id_": "83d6ae8b-b5b6-430a-b3a4-d9b536323af4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_2.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_2.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 19964, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6ba9ae5b-7378-4e65-9fff-808263e12d71", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_2.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_2.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 19964, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "7e10fbfe9fe613586d51118017d0e49aa9d5658ae1d921cc2ce8476a1b46fef3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e920627b-c6f7-45d4-922b-f77640daf77e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_2.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_2.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 19964, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "6d775ab9853cae42fdeaf38aac6a0541d6aa3b14039e1f6cb247df19e080f377", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a55e49be-104a-4c1a-b7d9-f48e61e5f729", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7092f995c6cf493e4c8012a93d925a7f090b41f5e76225bd3e90b64a9e728cae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "are largely ionized and are absorbed only on reaching the duodenum.

Thus, most drugs are absorbed better if taken in empty stomach. However, there are some exceptions, e.g. fatty food greatly enhances lumefantrine absorption. Highly ionized drugs, e.g. gentamicin, neostigmine are poorly absorbed when given orally.\n\nCertain drugs are degraded in the gastrointestinal tract, e.g. penicillin G by acid, insulin by peptidases, and are ineffective orally. Enteric coated tablets (having acid resistant coating) and sustained release preparations (drug particles coated with slowly dissolving material) can be used to overcome acid lability, gastric irritancy and brief duration of action.\n\nThe oral absorption of certain drugs is low because a fraction of the absorbed drug is extruded back into the intestinal lumen by the efflux transporter P-gp located in the gut epithelium. The low oral bioavailability of digoxin and cyclosporine is partly accounted by this mechanism. Inhibitors of P-gp like quinidine, verapamil, erythromycin, etc. enhance, while P-gp inducers like rifampin and phenobarbitone reduce the oral bioavailability of these drugs.\n\nAbsorption of a drug can be affected by other concurrently ingested drugs. This may be a luminal effect: formation of insoluble complexes, e.g. tetracyclines and iron preparations with calcium salts and antacids, phenytoin with sucralfate. Such interaction can be minimized by administering the two drugs at 2\u20133 hr intervals. Alteration of gut flora by antibiotics may disrupt the enterohepatic cycling of oral contraceptives and digoxin. Drugs can also alter absorption by gut wall effects: altering motility (anticholinergics, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids retard motility while metoclopramide enhances it) or causing mucosal damage (neomycin, methotrexate, vinblastine).\n\nSubcutaneous and Intramuscular\n\nBy these routes the drug is deposited directly in the vicinity of the capillaries. Lipid soluble drugs pass readily across the whole surface of the capillary endothelium. Capillaries having large paracellular spaces do not obstruct absorption of even large lipid insoluble molecules or ions (Fig. 2.9A). Very large molecules are absorbed through lymphatics. Thus, many drugs not absorbed orally are absorbed parenterally. Absorption from s.c. site is slower than that from i.m. site, but both are generally faster and more consistent/ predictable than oral absorption. Application of heat and muscular exercise accelerate drug absorption by increasing blood flow, while vasoconstrictors, e.g. adrenaline injected with the drug (local anaesthetic) retard absorption. Incorporation of hyaluronidase facilitates drug absorption from s.c. injection by promoting spread. Many depot preparations, e.g. benzathine penicillin, protamine zinc insulin, depot progestins, etc. can be given by these routes.\n\nTopical sites (skin, cornea, mucous membranes)\n\nSystemic absorption after topical application depends primarily on lipid solubility of drugs. However, only few drugs significantly penetrate intact skin. Hyoscine, fentanyl, GTN, nicotine, testosterone, and estradiol (see p. 12) have been used in this manner. Corticosteroids applied over extensive areas of skin can produce systemic effects and pituitary-adrenal suppression. Absorption can be promoted by rubbing the drug incorporated in an olegenous base or by use of occlusive dressing which increases hydration of the skin.

Mucous membranes of mouth, rectum, vagina absorb lipophilic drugs: estrogen cream applied vaginally has produced gynaecomastia in the male partner.\n\nBioavailability\n\nBioavailability refers to the rate and extent of absorption of a drug from a dosage form administered by any route, as determined by its concentration-time curve in blood or by its excretion in urine (Fig. 2.7). It is a measure of the fraction (F\u00a0) of administered dose of a drug that reaches the systemic circulation in the unchanged form. Bioavailability of drug injected i.v. is 100%, but is frequently lower after oral ingestion because\u2014\n\n(a) the drug may be incompletely absorbed.\n\n(b) the absorbed drug may undergo first pass metabolism in the intestinal wall/liver or be excreted in bile.\n\nIncomplete bioavailability after s.c. or i.m. injection is less common, but may occur due to local binding of the drug.\n\nBioequivalence Oral formulations of a drug from different manufacturers or different batches from the same manufacturer may have the same amount of the drug (chemically equivalent) but may not yield the same blood levels\u2014biologically inequivalent.\u00a0 Two preparations of a drug are considered bioequivalent when the rate and extent of bioavailability of the active drug from them is not significantly different under suitable test conditions. \n\nBefore a drug administered orally in solid dosage form can be absorbed, it must break into individual particles of the active drug (disintegration). Tablets and capsules contain a number of other materials\u2014diluents, stabilizing agents, binders, lubricants, etc. The nature of these as well as details of the manufacture process, e.g. force used in compressing the tablet, may affect disintegration. The released drug must then dissolve in the aqueous gastrointestinal contents. The rate of dissolution is governed by the inherent solubility, particle size, crystal form and other physical properties of the drug. Differences in bioavailability may arise due to variations in disintegration and dissolution rates.\n\nDifferences in bioavailability are seen mostly with poorly soluble and slowly absorbed drugs. Reduction in particle size increases the rate of absorption of aspirin (microfine tablets). The amount of griseofulvin and spironolactone in the tablet can be reduced to half if the drug particle is microfined.

Subsequently, there is a parallel decline in both due to elimination.\n\nApparent volume of distribution (V) Presuming that the body behaves as a single homogeneous compartment with volume V into which the drug gets immediately and uniformly distributed\n\nSince in the example shown in Fig. 2.8, the drug does not actually distribute into 20 L of body water, with the exclusion of the rest of it, this is only an apparent volume of distribution which can be defined as \u201cthe volume that would accommodate all the drug in the body, if the concentration throughout was the same as in plasma\u201d. Thus, it describes amount of the drug present in the body as a multiple of that contained in a unit volume of plasma. Considered together with drug clearance, this is a very useful pharmacokinetic concept.\n\n \n\nFactors governing volume of drug distribution\n\n\n\n\u2022Lipid: water partition coefficient of the drug\n\n\u2022pKa value of the drug\n\n\u2022Degree of plasma protein binding\n\n\u2022Affinity for different tissues\n\n\u2022Fat: lean body mass ratio, which can vary with age, sex, obesity, etc.\n\n\u2022Diseases like CHF, uremia, cirrhosis\n\nLipid-insoluble drugs do not enter cells\u2014V approximates extracellular fluid volume, e.g. streptomycin, gentamicin 0.25 L/kg.\n\nDistribution is not only a matter of dilution, but also binding and sequestration. Drugs extensively bound to plasma proteins are largely restricted to the vascular compartment and have low values of V, e.g. diclofenac and warfarin (99% bound) V = 0.15 L/kg.\n\nA large value of V indicates that larger quantity of drug is present in extravascular tissue. Drugs sequestrated in other tissues may have, V much more than total body water or even body mass, e.g. digoxin 6 L/kg, propranolol 4 L/kg, morphine 3.5 L/kg, because most of the drug is present in other tissues, and plasma concentration is low. Therefore, in case of poisoning, drugs with large volumes of distribution are not easily removed by haemodialysis.\n\nPathological states, e.g. congestive heart failure, uraemia, cirrhosis of liver, etc. can alter the V of many drugs by altering distribution of body water, permeability of membranes, binding proteins or by accumulation of metabolites that displace the drug from binding sites.\n\nMore precise multiple compartment models for drug distribution have been worked out, but the single compartment model, described above, is simple and fairly accurate for many drugs.\n\nRedistribution Highly lipid-soluble drugs get initially distributed to organs with high blood flow, i.e. brain, heart, kidney, etc. Later, less vascular but more bulky tissues (muscle, fat) take up the drug\u2014plasma concentration falls and the drug is withdrawn from the highly perfused sites. If the site of action of the drug was in one of the highly perfused organs, redistribution results in termination of drug action. Greater the lipid solubility of the drug, faster is its redistribution. Anaesthetic action of thiopentone sod. injected i.v. is terminated in few minutes due to redistribution. A relatively short hypnotic action lasting 6\u20138 hours is exerted by oral diazepam or nitrazepam due to redistribution despite their elimination t\u00bd of > 30 hr.

However, when the same drug is given repeatedly or continuously over long periods, the low perfusion high capacity sites get progressively filled up and the drug becomes longer acting.\n\nPenetration into brain and CSF The capillary endothelial cells in brain have tight junctions and lack large paracellular spaces. Further, an investment of neural tissue (Fig. 2.9B) covers the capillaries. Together they constitute the so called blood-brain barrier (BBB). A\n\nsimilar blood-CSF barrier is located in the choroid plexus: capillaries are lined by choroidal epithelium having tight junctions. Both these barriers are lipoidal and limit the entry of nonlipid-soluble drugs, e.g. streptomycin, neostigmine, etc. Only lipid-soluble drugs, therefore, are able to penetrate and have action on the central nervous system. In addition, efflux transporters like P-gp and anion transporter (OATP) present in brain and choroidal vessels extrude many drugs that enter brain by other processes and serve to augment the protective barrier against potentially harmful xenobiotics. Dopamine does not enter brain but its precursor levodopa does; as such, the latter is used in parkinsonism. Inflammation of meninges or brain increases permeability of these barriers. It has been proposed that some drugs accumulate in the brain by utilizing the transporters for endogenous substances.\n\n \n\nThere is also an enzymatic BBB: Monoamine oxidase (MAO), cholinesterase and some other enzymes are present in the capillary walls or in the cells lining them. They do not allow catecholamines, 5-HT, acetylcholine, etc. to enter brain in the active form.\n\nThe BBB is deficient at the CTZ in the medulla oblongata (even lipid-insoluble drugs are emetic) and at certain periventricular sites\u2014(anterior hypothalamus). \n\nExit of drugs from the CSF and brain, however, is not dependent on lipid-solubility and is rather unrestricted. This is due to bulk flow of CSF (alongwith the drug dissolved in it) back into blood through the arachnoid villi. Further, nonspecific organic anion and cation transport processes (similar to those in renal tubule) operate at the choroid plexus.\n\nPassage across placenta Placental membranes are lipoidal and allow free passage of lipophilic drugs, while restricting hydrophilic drugs. The placental efflux P-gp and other transporters like BCRP, MRP3 also serve to limit foetal exposure to maternally administered drugs. Placenta is a site for drug metabolism as well, which may lower/modify exposure of the foetus to the administered drug. However, restricted amounts of nonlipid-soluble drugs, when present in high concentration or for long periods in maternal circulation, gain access to the foetus. Some influx transporters also operate at the placenta. Thus, it is an incomplete barrier and almost any drug taken by the mother can affect the foetus or the newborn (drug taken just before delivery, e.g. morphine).\n\nPlasma protein binding \n\nMost drugs possess physicochemical affinity for plasma proteins and get reversibly bound to these. Acidic drugs generally bind to plasma albumin and basic drugs to \u03b11 acid glycoprotein. Binding to albumin (which is more abundant) is quantitatively more important. Extent of binding depends on the individual compound; no generalization for a pharmacological or chemical class can be made (even small chemical change can markedly alter protein binding), for example the binding percentage of some benzodiazepines is:\n\nFlurazepam10%Alprazolam70%\n\nLorazepam90%Diazepam99%\n\nIncreasing concentrations of the drug can progressively saturate the binding sites: fractional binding may be lower when large amounts of the drug are given.", "start_char_idx": 25371, "end_char_idx": 29692, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "667ddb79-a9ab-4402-879d-ebbdfd94aaa8": {"__data__": {"id_": "667ddb79-a9ab-4402-879d-ebbdfd94aaa8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_2.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_2.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 19964, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6ba9ae5b-7378-4e65-9fff-808263e12d71", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_2.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_2.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 19964, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "7e10fbfe9fe613586d51118017d0e49aa9d5658ae1d921cc2ce8476a1b46fef3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d429c65f-c61d-4e8d-a2e6-d901a2657545", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_2.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_2.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 19964, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "fb040eba952588b98c670702ba1a0d90ed240745ebec7caa04bd5423a0686a97", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "862435b6-4325-4351-988c-f02e29407a59", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f15e4d30dfe36ede380b00018bc8a607e7e79038487bf613aa3e63ee429c9ca6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Thus, it is an incomplete barrier and almost any drug taken by the mother can affect the foetus or the newborn (drug taken just before delivery, e.g. morphine).\n\nPlasma protein binding \n\nMost drugs possess physicochemical affinity for plasma proteins and get reversibly bound to these.

The generally expressed percentage binding refers to the usual therapeutic plasma concentrations of a drug. The clinically significant implications of plasma protein binding are:\n\n(i) Highly plasma protein bound drugs are largely restricted to the vascular compartment\u00a0 because protein bound drug does not cross membranes (except through large paracellular spaces, such as in capillaries). They tend to have smaller volumes of distribution.\n\nDrugs highly bound to plasma protein\n\n\n\nTo albumin\n\nTo \u03b11-acid glycoprotein\n\nBarbiturates\n\n\u03b2-blockers\n\nBenzodiazepines\n\nBupivacaine\n\nNSAIDs\n\nLidocaine\n\nValproic acid\n\nDisopyramide\n\nPhenytoin\n\nImipramine\n\nPenicillins\n\nMethadone\n\nSulfonamides\n\nPrazosin\n\nTetracyclines\n\nQuinidine\n\nTolbutamide\n\nVerapamil\n\nWarfarin\n\n\n\n(ii) The bound fraction is not available for action. However, it is in equilibrium with the free drug in plasma and dissociates when the concentration of the latter is reduced due to elimination. Plasma protein binding thus tantamounts to temporary storage of the drug.\n\n(iii) High degree of protein binding generally makes the drug long acting, because bound fraction is not available for metabolism or excretion, unless it is actively extracted by liver or by kidney tubules. Glomerular filtration does not reduce the concentration of the free form in the efferent vessels, because water is also filtered. Active tubular secretion, however, removes the drug without the attendant solvent \u2192 concentration of free drug falls \u2192 bound drug dissociates and is eliminated resulting in a higher renal clearance value of the drug than the total renal blood flow (see Fig. 3.3). The same is true of active transport of highly extracted drugs in liver. Plasma protein binding in this situation acts as a carrier mechanism and hastens drug elimination, e.g. excretion of penicillin (elimination t\u00bd is 30 min); metabolism of lidocaine. Highly protein bound drugs are not removed by haemodialysis and need special techniques for treatment of poisoning.\n\n(iv) The generally expressed plasma concentrations of the drug refer to bound as well as free drug. Degree of protein binding should be taken into account while relating these to concentrations of the drug that are active in vitro, e.g. MIC of an antimicrobial.\n\n(v) One drug can bind to many sites on the albumin molecule. Conversely, more than one drug can bind to the same site. This can give rise to displacement interactions among drugs bound to the same site(s). The drug bound with higher affinity will displace that bound with lower affinity and tend to increase the concentration of its free form. This, however, is often transient because the displaced drug will diffuse into the tissues as well as get metabolized or excreted: the new steady-state free drug concentration is only marginally higher unless the displacement extends to tissue binding or there is concurrent inhibition of metabolism and/or excretion reducing drug clearance. The overall impact of many displacement interactions is minimal; except when the interaction is more complex. Moreover, two highly bound drugs do not necessarily displace each other\u2014their binding sites may not overlap, e.g. probenecid and indomethacin are highly bound to albumin but do not displace each other. Similarly, acidic drugs do not generally displace basic drugs and vice versa. \n\nDrugs concentrated in tissues", "start_char_idx": 28778, "end_char_idx": 33062, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "862435b6-4325-4351-988c-f02e29407a59": {"__data__": {"id_": "862435b6-4325-4351-988c-f02e29407a59", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_2.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_2.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 19964, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6ba9ae5b-7378-4e65-9fff-808263e12d71", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_2.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_2.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 19964, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "7e10fbfe9fe613586d51118017d0e49aa9d5658ae1d921cc2ce8476a1b46fef3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "667ddb79-a9ab-4402-879d-ebbdfd94aaa8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_2.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_2.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 19964, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "4c23946823a5f03cf08e1c4f0d8e00fc5de3e08ed1995c2cdb12099894972c5b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7b08b611-a4f5-4999-8d46-6920b2a569a1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "251b724e5c7822939ed973ffb6c41472fc762375e214c4c7766cd412ceb4f754", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Skeletal muscle, heart\n\n\u2014\n\ndigoxin, emetine (bound to muscle proteins).\n\nLiver\n\n\u2014\n\nchloroquine, tetracyclines, emetine, digoxin.\n\nKidney\n\n\u2014\n\ndigoxin, chloroquine, emetine.\n\nThyroid\n\n\u2014\n\niodine.\n\nBrain\n\n\u2014\n\nchlorpromazine, acetazolamide, isoniazid.\n\nRetina\n\n\u2014\n\nchloroquine (bound to nucleoproteins).\n\nIris\n\n\u2014\n\nephedrine, atropine (bound to melanin).\n\nBone and teeth\n\n\u2014\n\ntetracyclines, heavy metals (bound to mucopolysaccharides of \n\nconnective tissue), bisphosphonates (bound to hydroxyapatite).\n\nAdipose tissue\n\n\u2014\n\nthiopentone, ether, minocycline, phenoxybenzamine, DDT \n\ndissolve in neutral fat due to high lipid-solubility; remain \n\nstored due to poor blood supply of fat.\n\n(vi) In hypoalbuminemia, binding may be reduced and high concentrations of free drug may be attained, e.g. phenytoin and furosemide.

It is needed to render nonpolar (lipid-soluble) compounds polar (lipid-insoluble) so that they are not reabsorbed in the renal tubules and are excreted. In the absence of metabolism, body will not be able to get rid of lipophylic substances, and they will become very long acting. Most hydrophilic drugs, e.g. streptomycin, neostigmine, pancuronium, etc. are little biotransformed and are largely excreted unchanged. Mechanisms which metabolize drugs (essentially foreign substances or Xenobiotics) have developed to protect the body from ingested toxins and other environmental chemicals.\n\nThe primary site for drug metabolism is liver; others are\u2014kidney, intestine, lungs and plasma. Biotransformation of drugs may lead to the following.\n\n(i) Inactivation Most drugs and their active metabolites are rendered inactive or less active, e.g. ibuprofen, paracetamol, lidocaine, chloramphenicol, propranolol and its active metabolite 4-hydroxypropranolol. Thus, biotransformation provides an alternative method of terminating drug action to excretion.\n\n(ii) Active metabolite from an active drug Many drugs have been found to be partially converted to one or more active metabolite; the effects observed are the sumtotal of that due to the parent drug and its active metabolite(s) (see box).\n\n(iii) Activation of inactive drug Few drugs are inactive as such and need conversion in the body to one or more active metabolites. Such a drug is called a prodrug (see box). The prodrug may offer advantages over the active form in being more stable, having better bioavailability or other desirable pharmacokinetic properties or less side effects and toxicity. Some prodrugs are activated selectively at the site of action.\n\nActive drugActive metabolite\n\n\n\nMorphine\n\n\u2014\n\nMorphine-6-glucuronide\n\nCefotaxime\n\n\u2014\n\nDesacetyl cefotaxime\n\nAllopurinol\n\n\u2014\n\nAlloxanthine\n\nProcainamide\n\n\u2014\n\nN-acetyl procainamide\u00a0 \n\nPrimidone\n\n\u2014\n\nPhenobarbitone, phenylethylmalonamide\n\nDiazepam\n\n\u2014\n\nDesmethyl-diazepam, oxazepam\n\nDigitoxin\n\n\u2014\n\nDigoxin\n\nImipramine\n\n\u2014\n\nDesipramine\n\nAmitriptyline\n\n\u2014\n\nNortriptyline\n\n\n\nCodeine\n\n\u2014\n\nMorphine\n\nSpironolactone\n\n\u2014\n\nCanrenone\n\nLosartan\n\n\u2014\n\nE 3174 \n\nBiotransformation reactions can be classified into:\n\n(a) Nonsynthetic/Phase I/Functionalization reactions: a functional group (\u2013OH, \u2013COOH, \u2013CHO, \u2013NH2, \u2013SH) is generated or exposed\u2014metabolite may be active or inactive.\n\n(b) Synthetic/Conjugation/ Phase II reactions: an endogenous radical is conjugated to the drug\u2014metabolite is mostly inactive; except few drugs, e.g. glucuronide conjugate of morphine and sulfate conjugate of minoxidil are active.

Various oxidation reactions are:\n\nhydroxylation; oxygenation at C, N or S atoms; N or O-dealkylation, oxidative deamination, etc.\n\nIn many cases the initial insertion of oxygen atom into the drug molecule produces short lived highly reactive quinone/epoxide/superoxide intermediates which then convert to more stable compounds.\n\nOxidative reactions are mostly carried out by a group of monooxygenases in the liver, which in the final step involve a cytochrome P-450 haemoprotein, NADPH, cytochrome P-450 reductase and molecular O2. More than 100 cytochrome P-450 (CYP) isoenzymes differing in their affinity for various substrates (drugs), have been identified. The CYP isoenzymes important for drug metabolism in humans, along with their clinically relevant substrate drugs, inhibitors and inducers are listed in Table 3.1\n\nDepending upon the extent of amino acid sequence homology, the cytochrome P-450 (CYP) isoenzymes are grouped into families designated by numerals (1, 2, 3.....), each having several sub-families designated by capital letters (A, B, C.....), while individual isoenzymes are again alloted numerals (1, 2, 3....). In human beings, only a few members of three isoenzyme families (CYP 1, 2 and 3) carryout metabolism of most of the drugs, and many drugs such as tolbutamide, barbiturates, phenytoin, paracetamol are substrates for more than one isoform. The CYP isoenzymes important in man are:\n\nCYP3A4/5 Carryout biotransformation of largest number (nearly 50%) of drugs. In addition to liver, these isoforms are expressed in intestine (responsible for first pass metabolism at this site) and kidney as well. Inhibition of this isoenzyme by erythromycin, clarithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole is responsible for the important drug interaction with terfenadine, astemizole and cisapride (see p. 181) which are its substrates. Verapamil, ritonavir and a constituent of grape fruit juice are other important inhibitors.\n\nCYP2D6 This is the next most important CYP isoform which metabolizes nearly 20% drugs including tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, many neuroleptics, antiarrhythmics, codeine, debrisoquine, metoprolol. Inhibition of this enzyme by quinidine results in failure of conversion of codeine to morphine \u2192 analgesic effect of codeine is lost. Human subjects can be grouped into \u2018extensive\u2019 or \u2018poor\u2019 metabolizers of metoprolol and debrisoquin. The poor metabolizers have an altered CYP2D6 enzyme and exhibit low capacity to hydroxylate many drugs. An ultrarapid metabolizer genotype of CYP2D6 has also been identified.\n\nCYP2C8/9 Important in the biotransformation of >15 commonly used drugs including phenytoin, carbamazepine, warfarin which are narrow safety margin drugs.\n\nCYP2C19 Metabolizes > 12 frequently used drugs including omeprazole, lansoprazole, phenytoin, diazepam. Omeprazole and fluconazole are its inhibitors.\n\nCYP1A1/2 Though this subfamily participates in the metabolism of only few drugs like theophylline, caffeine, paracetamol, carbamazepine, it is more important for activation of procarcinogens. Polycyclic hydrocarbons, cigarette smoke and charbroiled meat are its potent inducers.\n\nCYP2E1 It catalyses oxidation of alcohol, holothane, and formation of minor metabolites of few drugs, notably the hepatotoxic N-acetyl benzoquinoneimine from paracetamol; chronic alcoholism induces this isoenzyme.\n\nThe relative amount of different cytochrome P-450s differs among species and among individuals of the same species.

It is normally a minor pathway. However, it serves to inactivate highly reactive quinone or epoxide intermediates formed during metabolism of certain drugs, e.g. paracetamol. When large amount of such intermediates are formed (in poisoning or after enzyme induction), glutathione supply falls short\u2014toxic adducts are formed with tissue constituents resulting in hepatic, renal and other tissue damage.\n\n(vii) Ribonucleoside/nucleotide synthesis This pathway is important for the activation of many purine and pyrimidine antimetabolites used in cancer chemotherapy.\n\nMost drugs are metabolized by multiple pathways, simultaneously or sequentially as illustrated in Fig. 3.1. Rates of reaction by different pathways often vary considerably. A variety of metabolites (some more, some less) of a drug may be produced. Stereoisomers of a drug may be metabolized differently and at different rates, e.g. S-warfarin rapidly undergoes ring oxidation, while R-warfarin is slowly degraded by sidechain reduction.\n\nOnly a few drugs are metabolized by enzymes of intermediary metabolism, e.g. alcohol by dehydrogenase, allopurinol by xanthine oxidase, succinylcholine and procaine by plasma cholinesterase, adrenaline by monoamine oxidase. Majority of drugs are acted on by relatively nonspecific enzymes which are directed to types of molecules rather than to specific drugs. The same enzyme can metabolize many drugs. The drug metabolising enzymes are divided into two types:\n\nMicrosomal enzymes These are located on smooth endoplasmic reticulum (a system of microtubules inside the cell), primarily in liver, also in kidney, intestinal mucosa and lungs. The monooxygenases, cytochrome P450, UGTs, epoxide hydrolases, etc. are microsomal enzymes.\n\nThey catalyse most of the oxidations, reductions, hydrolysis and glucuronide conjugation. Microsomal enzymes are inducible by drugs, certain dietary constituents, and other agencies.\n\nNonmicrosomal enzymes These are present in the cytoplasm and mitochondria of hepatic cells as well as in other tissues including plasma. The esterases, amidases, some flavoprotein oxidases and most conjugases are nonmicrosomal. Reactions catalysed are:\n\nSome oxidations and reductions, many hydrolytic reactions and all conjugations except glucuronidation.\n\nThe nonmicrosomal enzymes are not inducible but many show genetic polymorphism (acetyl transferase, pseudocholinesterase) similar to the microsomal enzymes.\n\nBoth microsomal and nonmicrosomal enzymes are deficient in the newborn, especially premature, making them more susceptible to many drugs, e.g. chloramphenicol, opioids. This deficit is made up in the first few months, more quickly in case of oxidation and other phase I reactions than in case of glucuronide and other conjugations which take 3 or more months to reach adult levels.\n\nThe amount and kind of drug metabolizing enzymes is controlled genetically and is also altered by diet, environmental factors. Thus, marked interspecies and interindividual differences are seen, e.g. cats are deficient in UGTs while dogs are deficient in NATs. Upto 6-fold difference in the rate of metabolism of a drug among normal human adults may be observed. This is one of the major causes of individual variation in drug response.\n\nHofmann elimination This refers to inactivation of the drug in the body fluids by spontaneous molecular rearrangement without the agency of any enzyme, e.g. atracurium.", "start_char_idx": 12325, "end_char_idx": 16420, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5c3a40f0-da13-4755-abcf-003197e7cea2": {"__data__": {"id_": "5c3a40f0-da13-4755-abcf-003197e7cea2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_3.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_3.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 27821, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e7bc1c3a-1a8b-4b61-938f-539a73ed055e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_3.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_3.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 27821, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "5c0a97a957396e7e4f00abc0f49a235588c82cb58760e840a119e828d7dd1c22", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c00806ab-37a5-4b93-b912-824023bd8a77", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_3.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_3.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 27821, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "40f4d0fcc92e8eb562e39046d03b0c6a0b973b9e0b17b77e323ed936e7111334", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "87074b87-eece-49b7-a5d4-51539b9f067a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "df52fb08a54a975894ff55e11bc30c8343ab8793ed5bc00b7bf1e932703732c4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "chloramphenicol, opioids.

One drug can competitively inhibit the metabolism of another if it utilizes the same enzyme or cofactors. However, such interactions are not as common as one would expect, because often different drugs are substrates for different CYP-450 isoenzymes. It is thus important to know the CYP isoenzyme(s) that carry out the metabolism of a particular drug. A drug may be the substrate as well as inhibitor of the same Cyp isoenzyme. In case the drug inhibits its own metabolism, the oral bioavailability is likely to increase (for high first pass metabolism drugs), while systemic clearance is likely to decrease, prolonging plasma half life. On chronic dosing, the oral bioavailability of verapamil is nearly doubled and t\u00bd is prolonged, because it inhibits its own metabolism. A drug may also inhibit one isoenzyme while being itself a substrate of another isoenzyme, e.g. quinidine is metabolized mainly by CYP3A4 but inhibits CYP2D6. Moreover, majority of drugs, at therapeutic concentrations, are metabolized by non-saturation kinetics, i.e. the enzyme is present in excess. Clinically significant inhibition of drug metabolism occurs in case of drugs having affinity for the same isoenzyme, specially if they are metabolized by saturation kinetics or if kinetics changes from first order to zero order over the therapeutic range (capacity limited metabolism). The \u2018boosted\u2019 HIV-protease inhibitor (PI) strategy utilizes the potent CYP3A4 inhibitory action of low dose ritonavir to lower the dose of other PIs like atazanavir, lopinavir, saquinavir given concurrently. Obviously, inhibition of drug metabolism occurs in a dose related manner and can precipitate toxicity of the object drug (whose metabolism has been inhibited).\n\nBecause enzyme inhibition occurs by direct effect on the enzyme, it has a fast time course (within hours) compared to enzyme induction (see below).\n\nMetabolism of drugs with high hepatic extraction is dependent on liver blood flow (blood flow limited metabolism). Propranolol reduces rate of lidocaine metabolism by decreasing hepatic blood flow. Some other drugs whose rate of metabolism is limited by hepatic blood flow are morphine, propranolol, verapamil and imipramine.\n\nMicrosomal Enzyme Induction\n\nMany drugs, insecticides and carcinogens interact with DNA and increase the synthesis of microsomal enzyme protein, especially cytochrome P-450 and UGTs. As a result the rate of metabolism of inducing drug itself (autoinduction) and/or some other coadministered drugs is accelerated. \n\nDifferent inducers are relatively selective for certain cytochrome P-450 isoenzyme families, e.g.:\n\n\u2022Anticonvulsants (phenobarbitone, phenytoin, carbamazepine), rifampin, glucocorticoids induce CYP3A isoenzymes.\n\n\u2022Phenobarbitone and rifampin also induce CYP2D6 and CYP2C8/9.\n\n\u2022Carbamazepine and rifampin, in addition, induce CYP2C19 and CYP1A1/2.\n\n\u2022Isoniazid and chronic alcohol consumption induce CYP2E1.\n\n\u2022Polycyclic hydrocarbons like 3-methylcholanthrene and benzopyrene found in cigarette smoke, charcoalbroiled meat, omeprazole and industrial pollutants induce CYP1A isoenzymes.", "start_char_idx": 15574, "end_char_idx": 19763, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "87074b87-eece-49b7-a5d4-51539b9f067a": {"__data__": {"id_": "87074b87-eece-49b7-a5d4-51539b9f067a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_3.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_3.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 27821, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e7bc1c3a-1a8b-4b61-938f-539a73ed055e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_3.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_3.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 27821, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "5c0a97a957396e7e4f00abc0f49a235588c82cb58760e840a119e828d7dd1c22", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5c3a40f0-da13-4755-abcf-003197e7cea2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_3.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_3.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 27821, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "9c8b1c57886cdc35182c53693ec707949396bc362cfcfbec8b7f3e6c1666d42b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7bb7e158-15b4-4a58-adfa-9ac60e715315", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e281a8e0210c9b9a6b236bcae3ccbd08f500fede329770fb813d8923fa4c6299", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Different inducers are relatively selective for certain cytochrome P-450 isoenzyme families, e.g.:\n\n\u2022Anticonvulsants (phenobarbitone, phenytoin, carbamazepine), rifampin, glucocorticoids induce CYP3A isoenzymes.\n\n\u2022Phenobarbitone and rifampin also induce CYP2D6 and CYP2C8/9.\n\n\u2022Carbamazepine and rifampin, in addition, induce CYP2C19 and CYP1A1/2.\n\n\u2022Isoniazid and chronic alcohol consumption induce CYP2E1.\n\n\u2022Polycyclic hydrocarbons like 3-methylcholanthrene and benzopyrene found in cigarette smoke, charcoalbroiled meat, omeprazole and industrial pollutants induce CYP1A isoenzymes.\n\n\u2022Other enzyme inducers are: chronic alcoholism, nevirapine, griseofulvin, DDT.\n\nSince different CYP isoenzymes are involved in the metabolism of different drugs, every inducer increases biotransformation of certain drugs but not that of others.

Decreased intensity and/or duration of action of drugs that are inactivated by metabolism, e.g. failure of contraception with oral contraceptives and loss of anti-HIV action of nevirapine due to rifampin coadministration.\n\n2. Increased intensity of action of drugs that are activated by metabolism. Acute paracetamol toxicity is due to one of its metabolites\u2014toxicity occurs at lower doses in patients receiving enzyme inducers.\n\n3. Tolerance\u2014if the drug induces its own metabolism (autoinduction), e.g. carbamazepine, rifampin; nevirapine dose needs to be doubled after 2 weeks.\n\n4. Some endogenous substrates (steroids, bilirubin) are also metabolized faster.\n\n5. Precipitation of acute intermittent porphyria: enzyme induction increases porphyrin synthesis by derepressing \u03b4-aminolevulinic acid synthetase.\n\n6. Intermittent use of an inducer may interfere with adjustment of dose of another drug prescribed on regular basis, e.g. oral anticoagulants, oral hypoglycaemics, antiepileptics, antihypertensives.\n\n7.

Congenital nonhaemolytic jaundice: It is due to deficient glucuronidation of bilirubin; phenobarbitone hastens clearance of jaundice.\n\n2. Cushing\u2019s syndrome: phenytoin may reduce the manifestations by enhancing degradation of adrenal steroids which are produced in excess.\n\n3. Chronic poisonings: by faster metabolism of the accumulated poisonous substance.\n\n4. Liver disease.\n\nFirst-pass (Presystemic) Metabolism\n\nThis refers to metabolism of a drug during its passage from the site of absorption into the systemic circulation. All orally administered drugs are exposed to drug metabolizing enzymes in the intestinal wall and liver (where they first reach through the portal vein). Presystemic metabolism in the gut and liver can be avoided by administering the drug through sublingual, transdermal or parenteral routes. However, limited presystemic metabolism can occur in the skin (transdermally administered drug) and in lungs (for drug reaching venous blood through any route). The extent of first pass metabolism differs for different drugs (Table 3.2) and is an important determinant of oral bioavailability.\n\nA drug can also be excreted as such into bile.

Drugs and their metabolites are excreted in:\n\n1.Urine Drug excretion in urine occurs via the kidney. It is the most important channel of excretion for majority of drugs (see below).\n\n2.Faeces Apart from the unabsorbed fraction, most of the drug present in faeces is derived from bile. Liver actively transports into bile organic acids (especially drug glucuronides by OATP and MRP2), organic bases (by OCT), other lipophilic drugs (by P-gp) and steroids by distinct nonspecific active transport mechanisms. Relatively larger molecules (MW > 300) are preferentially eliminated in the bile. Most of the free drug in the gut, including that released by deconjugation of glucuronides by enteric bacteria is reabsorbed (enterohepatic cycling) and ultimate excretion occurs in urine (Fig. 3.2). Only the remaining is excreted in the faeces. Enterohepatic cycling contributes to longer stay of the drug in the body. Drugs that attain high concentrations in bile include erythromycin, ampicillin, rifampin, tetracycline, oral contraceptives, vecuronium, phenolphthalein. \n\nCertain drugs are excreted directly in colon, e.g. anthracene purgatives, heavy metals.\n\n3.Exhaled air Gases and volatile liquids (general anaesthetics, alcohol) are eliminated by lungs, irrespective of their lipid solubility. Alveolar transfer of the gas/vapour depends on its partial pressure in the blood. Lungs also serve to trap and extrude any particulate matter that enters circulation. \n\n4.Saliva and sweat These are of minor importance for drug excretion. Lithium, pot. iodide, rifampin and heavy metals are present in these secretions in significant amounts. Most of the saliva along with the drug in it, is swallowed and meets the same fate as orally taken drug.\n\n5.Milk The excretion of drug in milk is not important for the mother, but the suckling infant inadvertently receives the drug. Most drugs enter breast milk by passive diffusion. As such, more lipid soluble and less protein bound drugs cross better. Milk has a lower pH (7.0) than plasma, basic drugs are somewhat more concentrated in it. However, the total amount of drug reaching the infant through breast feeding is generally small and majority of drugs can be given to lactating mothers without ill effects on the infant. Nevertheless, it is advisable to administer any drug to a lactating woman only when essential. Drugs that are safe, as well as those contraindicated during breast feeding or need special caution are given in Appendix-3 at the end of the book.\n\n\n\nRENAL EXCRETION\n\nThe kidney is responsible for excreting all water soluble substances. The amount of drug or its metabolites ultimately present in urine is the sum total of glomerular filtration, tubular reabsorption and tubular secretion (Fig. 3.3).\n\n\n\nNet renal excretion\n\n=\n\n(Glomerular filtration + tubular secretion) \u2013 tubular reabsorption\n\nGlomerular filtration Glomerular capillaries have pores larger than usual; all nonprotein bound drug (whether lipid-soluble or insoluble) presented to the glomerulus is filtered. Thus, glomerular filtration of a drug depends on its plasma protein binding and renal blood flow. Glomerular filtration rate (g.f.r.), normally ~ 120 ml/min, declines progressively after the age of 50, and is low in renal failure. Glomerular filtration of drugs declines in parallel.\n\nTubular reabsorption This occurs by passive diffusion and depends on the lipid solubility and ionization of the drug at the existing urinary pH. Lipid-soluble drugs filtered at the glomerulus back diffuse in the tubules because 99% of glomerular filtrate is reabsorbed, but nonlipid-soluble and highly ionized drugs are unable to do so. Thus, rate of excretion of such drugs, e.g. aminoglycoside antibiotics, quaternary ammonium compounds parallels g.f.r. (or creatinine clearance).", "start_char_idx": 24321, "end_char_idx": 28698, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "95cf0ed0-0d60-4378-a072-078b15a17977": {"__data__": {"id_": "95cf0ed0-0d60-4378-a072-078b15a17977", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_3.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_3.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 27821, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e7bc1c3a-1a8b-4b61-938f-539a73ed055e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_3.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_3.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 27821, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "5c0a97a957396e7e4f00abc0f49a235588c82cb58760e840a119e828d7dd1c22", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "74a61e2f-26b2-4f2c-b44c-eddcff375456", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_3.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_3.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 27821, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "1101365df75613fb2fcece0f7fcefb09e15b5693c125dbbaf339add8e419e818", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f6607b4a-be58-4eae-9eb6-6a832ce0ec3e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "04f9f2c140743ee52eee57ffe107fc52bfd49d98eb3fe114fb46bca020968bdc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Thus, glomerular filtration of a drug depends on its plasma protein binding and renal blood flow.

Changes in urinary pH affect tubular reabsorption of drugs that are partially ionized\u2014\n\n\u2022Weak bases ionize more and are less reabsorbed in acidic urine.\n\n\u2022Weak acids ionize more and are less reabsorbed in alkaline urine.\n\nThis principle is utilized for facilitating elimination of the drug in poisoning, i.e. urine is alkalinized in barbiturate and salicylate poisoning. Though elimination of weak bases (morphine, amphetamine) can be enhanced by acidifying urine, this is not practiced clinically, because acidosis can induce rhabdomyolysis, cardiotoxicity and actually worsen outcome. The effect of changes in urinary pH on drug excretion is greatest for those having pKa values between 5 to 8, because only in their case pH dependent passive reabsorption is significant.\n\nTubular secretion This is the active transfer of organic acids and bases by two separate classes of relatively nonspecific transporters (OAT and OCT) which operate in the proximal tubules. In addition, efflux transporters P-gp and MRP2 are located in the luminal membrane of proximal tubular cells. If renal clearance of a drug is greater than 120 mL/min (g.f.r.), additional tubular secretion can be assumed to be occurring.\n\nActive transport of the drug across tubules reduces concentration of its free form in the tubular vessels and promotes dissociation of protein bound drug, which then becomes available for secretion (Fig. 3.3). Thus, protein binding, which is a hindrance for glomerular filtration of the drug, is not so (may even be facilitatory) to excretion by tubular secretion.\n\n(a) Organic acid transport (through OATP) operates for penicillin, probenecid, uric acid, salicylates, indomethacin, sulfinpyrazone, nitrofurantoin, methotrexate, drug glucuronides and sulfates, etc.\n\n(b) Organic base transport\u00a0 (through OCT) operates for thiazides, amiloride, triamterene, furosemide, quinine, procainamide, choline, cimetidine, etc.\n\nInherently both transport processes are bidirectional, i.e. they can transport their substrates from blood to tubular fluid and vice versa. However, for drugs and their metabolites (exogenous substances) secretion into the tubular lumen predominates, whereas an endogenous substrate like uric acid is predominantly reabsorbed.\n\nDrugs utilizing the same active transport compete with each other. Probenecid is an organic acid which has high affinity for the tubular OATP. It blocks the active transport of both penicillin and uric acid, but whereas the net excretion of the former is decreased, that of the latter is increased. This is because penicillin is primarily secreted while uric acid is primarily reabsorbed. Many drug interactions occur due to competition for tubular secretion, e.g.\n\n(i) Aspirin blocks uricosuric action of probenecid and sulfinpyrazone and decrease tubular secretion of methotrexate.\n\n(ii) Probenecid decreases the concentration of nitrofurantoin in urine, increases the duration of action of penicillin/ampicillin and impairs secretion of methotrexate.\n\n(iii) Sulfinpyrazone inhibits excretion of tolbutamide.\n\n(iv) Quinidine decreases renal and biliary clearance of digoxin by inhibiting efflux carrier P-gp.\n\nTubular transport mechanisms are not well developed at birth.

Renal function again progressively declines after the age of 50 years; renal clearance of most drugs is substantially lower in the elderly (>75 yr).\n\nKINETICS OF ELIMINATION\n\nThe knowledge of kinetics of elimination of a drug provides the basis for, as well as serves to devise rational dosage regimens and to modify them according to individual needs. There are three fundamental pharmacokinetic parameters, viz. bioavailability (F), volume of distribution (V) and clearance (CL) which must be understood. The first two have already been considered.\n\nDrug elimination is the sumtotal of metabolic inactivation and excretion. As depicted in Fig. 2.1, drug is eliminated only from the central compartment (blood) which is in equilibrium with peripheral compartments including the site of action. Depending upon the ability of the body to eliminate a drug, a certain fraction of the central compartment may be considered to be totally \u2018cleared\u2019 of that drug in a given period of time to account for elimination over that period.\n\nClearance (CL) The clearance of a drug is the theoretical volume of plasma from which the drug is completely removed in unit time (analogy creatinine clearance; Fig. 3.4). It can be calculated as:\n\n\u00a0 CL = Rate of elimination/C...(3)\n\nwhere C is the plasma concentration.\n\nFor majority of drugs the processes involved in elimination are not saturated over the clinically obtained concentrations, they follow:\n\nFirst order kinetics The rate of elimination is directly proportional to the drug concentration, CL remains constant; or a constant fraction of the drug present in the body is eliminated in unit time. This applies to majority of drugs which do not saturate the elimination processes (transporters, enzymes, blood flow, etc.) over the therapeutic concentration range.\n\nHowever, if the dose is high enough, elimination pathways of all drugs will get saturated. \n\nFew drugs normally saturate eliminating mechanisms and are handled by\u2014\n\nZero order kinetics The rate of elimination remains constant irrespective of drug concentration, CL decreases with increase in concentration; or a constant amount of the drug is eliminated in unit time, e.g. ethyl alcohol. This is also called capacity limited elimination or Michaelis-Menten elimination.\n\n \n\nThe elimination of some drugs approaches saturation over the therapeutic range, kinetics changes from first order to zero order at higher doses. As a result plasma concentration increases disproportionately with increase in dose (see Fig. 3.6), as occurs in case of phenytoin, tolbutamide, theophylline, warfarin. Since the dose rate-plasma concentration plot in this case is curved, it is also called \u2018nonlinear elimination\u2019.\n\nBlood flow dependent elimination For few drugs the eliminating capacity of an organ of elimination (kidney, liver) far exceeds the amount of drug normally presented to it by blood circulation. The elimination of such a drug becomes blood flow dependent. These highly extracted drugs are almost completely eliminated in a single passage through the organ of elimination.\n\nPlasma half-life The Plasma half-life (t\u00bd) of a drug is the time taken for its plasma concentration to be reduced to half of its original value.\n\nTaking the simplest case of a drug which has rapid one compartment distribution and first order elimination, and is given i.v. a semilog plasma concentration-time plot as shown in Fig. 3.5 is obtained. The plot has two slopes.\n\n\u2022initial rapidly declining (\u03b1) phase\u2014due to distribution.\n\n\u2022later less declined (\u03b2) phase\u2014due to elimination.\n\nAt least two half-lives (distribution t\u00bd and elimination t\u00bd) can be calculated from the two slopes. The elimination half life derived from the \u03b2 slope is simply called the \u2018half life\u2019 of the drug.\n\nMost drugs infact have multicompartment distribution and multiexponential decay of plasma concentration-time plot.", "start_char_idx": 31337, "end_char_idx": 35945, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "76675f37-2dc1-4916-ab1a-73a04075661f": {"__data__": {"id_": "76675f37-2dc1-4916-ab1a-73a04075661f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_3.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_3.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 27821, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e7bc1c3a-1a8b-4b61-938f-539a73ed055e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_3.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_3.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 27821, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "5c0a97a957396e7e4f00abc0f49a235588c82cb58760e840a119e828d7dd1c22", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f6607b4a-be58-4eae-9eb6-6a832ce0ec3e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_3.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_3.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 27821, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "1da886515d371a3ba9385a1b155d0cd1f121bc92b93aeff61974d9ed72975756", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "15120d0f-9ccd-425f-9ef1-aa5900ceea40", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "58bfcb39372d574979a10f1863cd4b18b043b1e6c7fdcc4ad0f55571c6b9bb5c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "These highly extracted drugs are almost completely eliminated in a single passage through the organ of elimination.\n\nPlasma half-life The Plasma half-life (t\u00bd) of a drug is the time taken for its plasma concentration to be reduced to half of its original value.\n\nTaking the simplest case of a drug which has rapid one compartment distribution and first order elimination, and is given i.v. a semilog plasma concentration-time plot as shown in Fig. 3.5 is obtained.

This continues with every dose until progressively increasing rate of elimination (which increases with increase in concentration) balances the amount administered over the dose interval. Subsequently plasma concentration plateaus and fluctuates about an average steady-state level. This is known as the plateau principle of drug accumulation. Steady-state is reached in 4\u20135 half lives unless dose interval is very much longer than t\u00bd (Fig. 3.7).\n\nThe amplitude of fluctuations in plasma concentration at steady-state depends on the dose interval relative to the t\u00bd, i.e. the difference between the maximum and minimum levels is less if smaller doses are repeated more frequently (dose rate remaining constant). Dose intervals are generally a compromise between what amplitude of fluctuations is clinically acceptable (because of loss of efficacy at troughs and side effects at peaks) and what frequency of dosing is convenient. However, if the dose rate is changed, a new average Cpss is attained over the next 4\u20135 half lives. When the drug is administered orally (absorption takes some time), average Cpss is approximately 1/3 of the way between the minimal and maximal levels in a dose interval.\n\nTarget level strategy For drugs whose effects are not easily quantifiable and safety margin is not big, e.g. anticonvulsants, antidepressants, lithium, antiarrhythmics, theophylline, some antimicrobials, etc. or those given to prevent an event, it is best to aim at achieving a certain plasma concentration which has been defined to be in the therapeutic range; such data are now available for most drugs of this type.\n\nDrugs with short t\u00bd (upto 2\u20133 hr) administered at conventional intervals (6\u201312 hr) achieve the target levels only intermittently and fluctuations in plasma concentration are marked. In case of many drugs (penicillin, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, propranolol) this however is therapeutically acceptable.\n\nFor drugs with longer t\u00bd a dose that is sufficient to attain the target concentration after single administration, if repeated will accumulate according to plateau principle and produce toxicity later on. On the other hand, if the dosing is such as to attain target level at steady state, the therapeutic effect will be delayed by about 4 half lives (this may be clinically unacceptable). Such drugs are often administered by initial loading and subsequent maintenance doses.\n\nLoading dose This is a single or few quickly repeated doses given in the beginning to attain target concentration rapidly. It may be calculated as\u2014\n\nThus, loading dose is governed only by V and not by CL or t\u00bd.\n\nMaintenance dose This dose is one that is to be repeated at specified intervals after the attainment of target Cpss so as to maintain the same by balancing elimination. The maintenance dose rate is computed by equation (9) and is governed by CL (or t\u00bd) of the drug. If facilities for measurement of drug concentration are available, attainment of target level in a patient can be verified subsequently and dose rate adjusted if required.\n\nSuch two phase dosing provides rapid therapeutic effect with long term safety; frequently applied to digoxin, chloroquine, long-acting sulfonamides, doxycycline, amiodarone, etc. However, if there is no urgency, maintenance doses can be given from the beginning. The concept of loading and maintenance dose is valid also for short t\u00bd drugs and i.v. administration in critically ill patients, e.g. lidocaine (t\u00bd 1.5 hr) used for cardiac arrhythmias is given as an i.v. bolus dose followed by slow i.v. infusion or intermittent fractional dosing.", "start_char_idx": 38375, "end_char_idx": 42860, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "555f2b72-72e3-4eac-bfa2-318d2096dbef": {"__data__": {"id_": "555f2b72-72e3-4eac-bfa2-318d2096dbef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_3.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_3.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 27821, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e7bc1c3a-1a8b-4b61-938f-539a73ed055e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_3.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_3.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 27821, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "5c0a97a957396e7e4f00abc0f49a235588c82cb58760e840a119e828d7dd1c22", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "15120d0f-9ccd-425f-9ef1-aa5900ceea40", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_3.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_3.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 27821, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "756ab81916c973dc1e5690ddc08f41b13d1c77c67612838939d09d9cf3ec0214", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8353908a-3f01-46cf-9e2d-a899a64b1b4e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "125b1baf185679171cd5e182449d32afba6a58fd95d9ccd074ecb2cef057ef34", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The maintenance dose rate is computed by equation (9) and is governed by CL (or t\u00bd) of the drug.

Because each of these parameters varies considerably among individuals, the actual Cpss in a patient may be 1/3 to 3 times that calculated on the basis of population data. Measurement of plasma drug concentration can give an estimate of the pharmacokinetic variables in that patient and the magnitude of deviation from the \u2018average patient\u2019, so that appropriate adjustments in the dosage regimen can be made.\n\nIn case of drugs obeying first order kinetics:\n\n \n\nTherapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is particularly useful in the following situations:\n\n1.Drugs with low safety margin, e.g. \u2014digoxin, anticonvulsants, antiarrhythmics, theophylline, aminoglycoside antibiotics, lithium, tricyclic antidepressants.\n\n2.If individual variations are large, e.g.\u2014antidepressants, lithium.\n\n3.Potentially toxic drugs used in the presence of renal failure, e.g. \u2014aminoglycoside antibiotics, vancomycin.\n\n4.In case of poisoning.\n\n5.In case of failure of response without any apparent reason, e.g. \u2014antimicrobials.\n\n6.To check patient compliance, e.g. \u2014psychopharmacological agents.\n\nSelection of the correct interval between drug administration and drawing of blood sample for TDM is critical, and depends on the purpose of TDM as well as the nature of the drug.\n\na.When the purpose is dose adjustment: In case of drugs which need to act continuously (relatively long-acting drugs), it is prudent to measure the trough steady-state blood levels, i.e. just prior to the next dose, because this is governed by both V and CL. On the other hand, for short-acting drugs which achieve therapeutic levels only intermittently (e.g. ampicillin, gentamicin), sampling is done in the immediate post-absorptive phase (usually after 1\u20132 hours of oral/i.m. dosing) to reflect the peak levels.\n\nb.In case of poisoning: Blood for drug level estimation should be taken at the earliest to confirm the poisoning and to assess its seriousness. It should then be repeated at intervals to estimate the drug clearance in the affected patient, and the need to hasten elimination (e.g. by haemodialysis).\n\nc.For checking compliance to medication: Even random blood sampling can be informative.\n\nMonitoring of plasma concentration is of no value for\n\n1.Drugs whose response is easily measurable, e.g.\u2014 antihypertensives, hypoglycaemics, diuretics, oral anticoagulants, inhalational general anaesthetics.\n\n2.Drugs activated in the body, e.g.\u2014levodopa.\n\n3.\u2018Hit and run drugs\u2019 (whose effect lasts much longer than the drug itself), e.g.\u2014reserpine, guanethidine, MAO inhibitors, omeprazole.\n\n4.Drugs with irreversible action, e.g.\u2014organophosphate anticholinesterases, phenoxybenzamine.\n\nPROLONGATION OF DRUG ACTION\n\nIt is sometimes advantageous to modify a drug in such a way that it acts for a longer period.

Drugs with t\u00bd < 4 hr are suitable for controlled release formulations, while there is no need of such formulations for drugs with t\u00bd >12 hr. Methods utilized for prolonging drug action are summarised below. Some of these have already been described.\n\n1. By prolonging absorption from site of administration\n\n(a) Oral Sustained release tablets, spansule capsules, etc.; drug particles are coated with resins, plastic materials or other substances which temporally disperse release of the active ingredient in the g.i.t. Another technique (controlled release tablet/capsule; Fig. 3.8) utilizes a semipermeable membrane to control the release of drug from the dosage form. Such preparations prolong the action by 4 to 8 hours and no more, because in that time drug particles reach the colon. Also, the drug release pattern and consequently the attained blood levels of the drug may be more variable than the regular tablet of the same drug.\n\n(b) Parenteral The s.c. and i.m. injection of drug in insoluble form (benzathine penicillin, lente insulin) or as oily solution (depot progestins); pellet implantation, sialistic and biodegradable implants can provide for its absorption over a couple of days to several months or even years. Inclusion of a vasoconstrictor with the drug also delays absorption (adrenaline with local anaesthetics).\n\n(c) Transdermal drug delivery systems The drug impregnated in adhesive patches, strips or as ointment applied on skin is utilized in some cases to prolong drug action, e.g. GTN (see p. 12).\n\n2. By increasing plasma protein binding \n\nDrug congeners have been prepared which are highly bound to plasma protein and are slowly released in the free active form, e.g. sulfadoxine.\n\n3. By retarding rate of metabolism Small chemical modification can markedly affect the rate of metabolism without affecting the biological action, e.g. addition of ethinyl group to estradiol (ethinyl estradiol) makes it longer acting and suitable for use as oral contraceptive. Inhibition of specific enzyme by one drug can prolong the action of another drug, e.g. allopurinol inhibits the degradation of 6-mercaptopurine, ritonavir boosts the levels of atazanavir/lopinavir/saquinavir, cilastatin protects imipenem from degradation in kidney.\n\n4. By retarding renal excretion The tubular secretion of drug being an active process, can be suppressed by a competing substance, e.g. probenecid prolongs duration of action of penicillin, ampicillin and amoxicillin.\n\nTargeted drug delivery devices\n\nSome new devices have been invented (and many are under development) to localise and prolong the delivery of the contained drug to a specific target organ. The ones already in use are: \n\n1. Liposomes These are unilamellar or bilamellar nano-vesicles (60\u201380 nM) produced by sonication of lecithin or other biodegradable phospholipids.

Liposomal amphotericin B is being used in Kala azar and some serious cases of systemic mycosis. Antibody tagging of liposomes is being tried as a means to target other specific tissues.  \n\n2. Drug releasing implants The implant is coated with the drug using special techniques and then placed in the target organ to provide prolonged delivery of minute quantities of the drug by slow release. Progestin impregnated intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) affords protection for upto 5 years. It is also being tried for other gynaecological problems.\n\nAntithrombotic drug coated stents (devices placed in the thrombosed coronary artery after balloon angioplasty to keep it patent) are in use to prevent restenosis and failure of angioplasty.", "start_char_idx": 48935, "end_char_idx": 50474, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c97f2292-5784-4226-a704-b7bf0d757868": {"__data__": {"id_": "c97f2292-5784-4226-a704-b7bf0d757868", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_4.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_4.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 35220, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "126e6ea9-0fe4-4748-9932-0355ce609a2b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_4.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_4.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 35220, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "02e0773500ee3030eaf8f83ff7b7c90cbc8f8b3acd73bc764f75ac039d7dfa55", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "713164ed-ffd6-4371-8e8c-fb1d00198670", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_3.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_3.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 27821, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "ff1ca80c8db6fac48f460973079cefef910500060ba996760baa019dd906301f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "339c055e-e82f-41d3-9d62-44bd4bb6d13e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f09de7394e5e8edf191d6a47e05de2307d919d486518509bd28d97a91d21fe11", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Chapter 4: Pharmacodynamics: Mechanism of drug action; Receptor Pharmacology\n\n\n\nPharmacodynamics is the study of drug effects. It starts with describing what the drugs do, and goes on to explain how they do it. Thus, it attempts to elucidate the complete action-effect sequence and the dose-effect relationship. Modification of the action of one drug by another drug is also an aspect of pharmacodynamics.\n\nPRINCIPLES OF DRUG ACTION\n\nDrugs (except those gene based) do not impart new functions to any system, organ or cell; they only alter the pace of ongoing activity. However, this alone can have profound medicinal as well as toxicological impact. The basic types of drug action can be broadly classed as:\n\n1. Stimulation It refers to selective enhancement of the level of activity of specialized cells, e.g. adrenaline stimulates heart, pilocarpine stimulates salivary glands. However, excessive stimulation is often followed by depression of that function, e.g. high dose of picrotoxin, a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant, produces convulsions followed by coma and respiratory depression.\n\n2. Depression It means selective diminution of activity of specialized cells, e.g. barbiturates depress CNS, quinidine depresses heart, omeprazole depresses gastric acid secretion. Certain drugs stimulate one type of cells but depress the other, e.g. acetylcholine stimulates intestinal smooth muscle but depresses SA node in heart. Thus, most drugs cannot be simply classed as stimulants or depressants.\n\n3. Irritation This connotes a nonselective, often noxious effect and is particularly applied to less specialized cells (epithelium, connective tissue). Strong irritation results in inflammation, corrosion, necrosis and morphological damage. This may result in diminution or loss of function.\n\n4. Replacement This refers to the use of natural metabolites, hormones or their congeners in deficiency states, e.g. levodopa in parkinsonism, insulin in diabetes mellitus, iron in anaemia.\n\n5. Cytotoxic action Selective cytotoxic action on invading parasites or cancer cells, attenuating them without significantly affecting the host cells is utilized for cure/palliation of infections and neoplasms, e.g. penicillin, chloroquine, zidovudine, cyclophosphamide, etc.\n\nMECHANISM OF DRUG ACTION\n\nOnly a handful of drugs act by virtue of their simple physical or chemical property; examples are:\n\n\u2022Bulk laxatives (ispaghula)\u2014physical mass\n\n\u2022Dimethicone, petroleum jelly\u2014physical form, opacity\n\n\u2022Paraamino benzoic acid\u2014absorption of UV rays\n\n\u2022Activated charcoal\u2014adsorptive property\n\n\u2022Mannitol, mag. sulfate\u2014osmotic activity\n\n\u2022131I and other radioisotopes\u2014radioactivity\n\n\u2022Antacids\u2014neutralization of gastric HCl\n\n\u2022Pot. permanganate\u2014oxidizing property\n\n\u2022Chelating agents (EDTA, dimercaprol)\u2014chelation of heavy metals.\n\n\u2022Cholestyramine\u2014sequestration of bile acids and cholesterol in the gut\n\n\u2022Mesna\u2014Scavenging of vasicotoxic reactive metabolites of cyclophosphamide \n\nMajority of drugs produce their effects by interacting with a discrete target biomolecules, which usually are proteins. Such mechanism confers selectivity of action to the drug. Functional proteins that are targets of drug action can be grouped into four major categories, viz. enzymes, ion channels, transporters and receptors (see Fig. 4.1). However, a few drugs do act on other proteins (e.g. colchicine, vinca alkaloids, taxanes bind to the structural protein tubulin) or on nucleic acids (alkylating agents).\n\nI. ENZYMES\n\nAlmost all biological reactions are carried out under catalytic influence of enzymes; hence, enzymes are a very important target of drug action. Drugs can either increase or decrease the rate of enzymatically mediated reactions. However, in physiological systems enzyme activities are often optimally set. Thus, stimulation of enzymes by drugs, that are truly foreign substances, is unusual. Enzyme stimulation is relevant to some natural metabolites only, e.g.\u00a0 pyridoxine acts as a cofactor and increases decarboxylase activity. Several enzymes are stimulated through receptors and second messengers, e.g. adrenaline stimulates hepatic glycogen phosphorylase through \u03b2 receptors and cyclic AMP.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4183, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "339c055e-e82f-41d3-9d62-44bd4bb6d13e": {"__data__": {"id_": "339c055e-e82f-41d3-9d62-44bd4bb6d13e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_4.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_4.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 35220, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "126e6ea9-0fe4-4748-9932-0355ce609a2b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_4.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_4.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 35220, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "02e0773500ee3030eaf8f83ff7b7c90cbc8f8b3acd73bc764f75ac039d7dfa55", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c97f2292-5784-4226-a704-b7bf0d757868", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_4.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_4.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 35220, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "58a8c008a090881dc7f68815e37fa3349e1815ab6dd5d3c5b2cb6c9839810304", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fb8dff72-4fb8-444c-8beb-7de9af1871cc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c542259207f3a48f5229aa02a197bbec739b6049e8e22a1b35860113b1074852", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "However, a few drugs do act on other proteins (e.g. colchicine, vinca alkaloids, taxanes bind to the structural protein tubulin) or on nucleic acids (alkylating agents).\n\nI.

Several enzymes are stimulated through receptors and second messengers, e.g. adrenaline stimulates hepatic glycogen phosphorylase through \u03b2 receptors and cyclic AMP. Stimulation of an enzyme increases its affinity for the substrate so that rate constant (kM) of the reaction is lowered (Fig. 4.2).\n\nApparent increase in enzyme activity can also occur by enzyme induction, i.e. synthesis of more enzyme protein. This cannot be called stimulation because the km does not change.

They have limited medicinal value restricted to external application only. However, selective inhibition of a particular enzyme is a common mode of drug action. Such inhibition is either competitive or noncompetitive.\n\n(i) Competitive (equilibrium type) The drug\u00a0 being structurally similar competes with the normal substrate for the catalytic binding site of the enzyme so that the product is not formed or a nonfunctional product is formed (Fig. 4.1A), and a new equilibrium is achieved in the presence of the drug. Such inhibitors increase the kM but the Vmax remains unchanged (Fig. 4.2), i.e. higher concentration of the substrate is required to achieve \u00bd maximal reaction velocity, but if substrate concentration is sufficiently increased, it can displace the inhibitor and the same maximal reaction velocity can be attained. Examples are given in the box above.\n\nA nonequilibrium type of enzyme inhibition can also occur with drugs which react with the same catalytic site of the enzyme but either form strong covalent bonds or have such high affinity for the enzyme that the normal substrate is not able to displace the inhibitor, e.g.\n\n\u2022Organophosphates react covalently with the esteretic site of the enzyme cholinesterase.\n\n\u2022Methotrexate has 50,000 times higher affinity for dihydrofolate reductase than the normal substrate DHFA.\n\nIn these situations, kM is increased and Vmax is reduced.\n\n(ii) Noncompetitive The inhibitor reacts with an adjacent site and not with the catalytic site, but alters the enzyme in such a way that it loses its catalytic property. Thus, kM is unchanged but Vmax is reduced.

ION CHANNELS\n\nProteins which act as ion selective channels participate in transmembrane signaling and regulate intracellular ionic composition. This makes them a common target of drug action (Fig. 4.1B). Drugs can affect ion channels, some of which actually are receptors, because they are operated by specific signal molecules either directly and are called ligand gated channels (e.g. nicotinic receptor, see Fig. 4.4) or through G-proteins and are termed G-protein regulated channels (e.g. cardiac \u03b21 adrenergic receptor activated Ca2+ channel, see Table 4.1). Drugs can also act on voltage operated and stretch sensitive channels by directly binding to the channel and affecting ion movement through it, e.g. local anaesthetics which\u00a0 obstruct voltage sensitive Na+ channels (see Ch. 26). In addition, certain drugs modulate opening and closing of the channels, e.g.:\n\n\u2022Quinidine blocks myocardial Na+ channels.\n\n\u2022Dofetilide and amiodarone block myocardial delayed rectifier K+ channel.\n\n\u2022Nifedipine blocks L-type of voltage sensitive Ca2+ channel.\n\n\u2022Nicorandil opens ATP-sensitive K+ channels.\n\n\u2022Sulfonylurea hypoglycaemics inhibit pan-creatic ATP-sensitive K+ channels (see Fig. 19.6).\n\n\u2022Amiloride inhibits renal epithelial Na+ channels (see Fig. 42.3).\n\n\u2022Phenytoin modulates (prolongs the inactivated state of) voltage sensitive neuronal Na+ channel (Fig. 30.1).\n\n\u2022Ethosuximide inhibits T-type of Ca2+ channels in thalamic neurones.\n\nIII. TRANSPORTERS\n\nSeveral substrates are translocated across membranes by binding to specific transporters (carriers) which either facilitate diffusion in the direction of the concentration gradient or pump the metabolite/ion against the concentration gradient using metabolic energy (see p. 18\u201319; Fig. 2.5). Many drugs produce their action by directly interacting with the solute carrier (SLC) class of transporter proteins to inhibit the ongoing physiological transport of the metabolite/ion (Fig. 4.1C). Examples are:\n\n\u2022Desipramine and cocaine block neuronal reuptake of noradrenaline by interacting with norepinephrine transporter (NET) as depicted in Fig. 9.4.\n\n\u2022Fluoxetine (and other SSRIs) inhibit neuronal reuptake of 5-HT by interacting with serotonin transporter (SERT), Fig. 33.1.\n\n\u2022Amphetamines selectively block dopamine reuptake in brain neurons by dopamine transporter (DAT).\n\n\u2022Reserpine blocks the vesicular reuptake of noradrenaline and 5-HT by the vesicular mono-amine transporter (VMAT-2), see Fig. 9.4.\n\n\u2022Hemicholinium blocks choline uptake into cholinergic neurones and depletes acetylcholine (see Fig. 7.1).\n\n\u2022The anticonvulsant tiagabine acts by inhibiting reuptake of GABA into brain neurones by GABA transporter GAT1 (see Fig. 30.1).\n\n\u2022Furosemide inhibits the Na+K+2Cl\u00af cotransporter in the ascending limb of loop of Henle (see Fig. 42.1).\n\n\u2022Hydrochlorothiazide inhibits the Na+Cl\u00af\u00a0 symporter in the early distal tubule (see Fig. 42.2).\n\n\u2022Probenecid inhibits active transport of organic acids (uric acid, penicillin) in renal tubules by interacting with organic anion transporter (OAT).\n\nIV.

If so applied, xanthine oxidase would be the \u2018receptor\u2019 for allopurinol, L-type Ca2+ channel would be the \u2018receptor\u2019 for nifedipine, serotonin transporter (SERT) would be the \u2018receptor\u2019 for fluoxetine; a connotation not in consonence with the general understanding of the term \u2018receptor\u2019. It is therefore better to reserve the term \u2018receptor\u2019 for purely regulatory macromolecules which combine with and mediate the action of signal molecules including drugs.\n\nThe following terms are used in describing drug-receptor interaction:\n\nAgonist An agent which activates a receptor to produce an effect similar to that of the physiological signal molecule.\n\nInverse agonist An agent which activates a receptor to produce an effect in the opposite direction to that of the agonist.\n\nAntagonist An agent which prevents the action of an agonist on a receptor or the subsequent response, but does not have any effect of its own.\n\nPartial agonist An agent which activates a receptor to produce submaximal effect but antagonizes the action of a full agonist.\n\nLigand (Latin: ligare\u2014to bind) Any molecule which attaches selectively to particular receptors or sites. The term only indicates affinity or ability to bind without regard to functional change: agonists and competitive antagonists are both ligands of the same receptor.\n\nThe overall scheme of drug action through receptors is depicted in Fig. 4.1D.\n\nBasic evidences for drug action through receptors\n\n(i) Many drugs exhibit structural specificity of action, i.e. specific chemical configuration is associated with a particular action, e.g. isopropyl substitution on the ethylamine side chain of sympathetic drugs produces compounds with marked cardiac and bronchial activity\u2014most b adrenergic agonists and antagonists have this substitution. A 3 carbon internitrogen separation in the side chain of phenothiazines results in antidopaminergic-antipsychotic compounds, whereas 2 carbon separation produces anticholinergic-antihistaminic compounds. Further, chiral drugs show stereospecificity in action, e.g. levo noradrenaline is 10 times more potent than dextro noradrenaline; d-propranolol is about 100 times less potent in blocking \u03b2 receptors than the l-isomer, but both are equipotent local anaesthetics.\n\nThus, the cell must have some mechanism to recognize a particular chemical configuration and three dimensional structure.", "start_char_idx": 9941, "end_char_idx": 13595, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "52966ef4-202e-4e8d-ad2b-44dbbda2f82d": {"__data__": {"id_": "52966ef4-202e-4e8d-ad2b-44dbbda2f82d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_4.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_4.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 35220, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "126e6ea9-0fe4-4748-9932-0355ce609a2b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_4.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_4.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 35220, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "02e0773500ee3030eaf8f83ff7b7c90cbc8f8b3acd73bc764f75ac039d7dfa55", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1ac7764a-947f-4a77-9697-f2075c190d1f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_4.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_4.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 35220, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "c108d338ebee313daa43904958ee6f82b698f142d37aa24b6fd1ca833a5344bd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d5b1f8f5-2e52-47c1-b459-3e6c935e32af", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2fbb97b7dfd4f98904d4f85e33a0e870128ac53ab171d2a5aa94601d1cff3811", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "specific chemical configuration is associated with a particular action, e.g. isopropyl substitution on the ethylamine side chain of sympathetic drugs produces compounds with marked cardiac and bronchial activity\u2014most b adrenergic agonists and antagonists have this substitution.

Langley in 1878 was so impressed by the mutual antagonism among two alkaloids pilocarpine and atropine that he proposed that both reacted with the same \u2018receptive substance\u2019 on the cell. Ehrlich (1900) observed quantitative neutralization between toxins and antitoxins and designated \u2018receptor\u2019 to be the anchoring group of the protoplasmic molecule for the administered compound.\n\n(iii) It was calculated by Clark that adrenaline and acetylcholine produce their maximal effect on frog\u2019s heart by occupying only 1/6000th of the cardiac cell surface\u2014thus, special regions of reactivity to such drugs must be present on the cell.\n\nReceptor occupation theory\n\nAfter studying quantitative aspects of drug action, Clark (1937) propounded a theory of drug action based on occupation of receptors by specific drugs and that the pace of a cellular function can be altered by interaction of these receptors with drugs which, in fact, are small molecular ligands. He perceived the interaction between the two molecular species, viz. drug (D\u00a0) and receptor (R) to be governed by the law of mass action, and the effect (E) to be a direct function of the drug-receptor complex (DR) formed:\n\n\n\nSubsequently, it was realized that occupation of the receptor is essential but not itself sufficient to elicit a response; the agonist must also be able to activate (induce a conformational change in) the receptor. The ability to bind with the receptor designated as affinity, and the capacity to induce a functional change in the receptor designated as intrinsic activity (IA) or efficacy are independent properties.\n\nAffinity of a drug for a receptor determines its concetration around the receptor required to form a certain number of drug-receptor associations (DRs). Higher affinity implies that the same number of DRs will be formed at lower concentrations of the drug, compared to another drug which has lower affinity.\n\nIntrinsic activity of a drug is a measure of its ability to induce a functional change in the receptor which could vary from 0 to 1 (nil to maximal).\n\nCompetitive antagonists occupy the receptor but do not activate it, while certain drugs are partial agonists which occupy and submaximally activate the receptor. An all or none action is not a must at the receptor. A theoretical quantity\u00a0(S) denoting strength of stimulus imparted to the cell was interposed in the Clark\u2019s equation:\n\n\n\nDepending on the agonist, DR could generate a stronger or weaker S, probably as a function of the degree of conformational change brought about by the agonist in the receptor. Accordingly:\n\nAgonists have both affinity and maximal intrinsic activity (IA = 1), e.g. adrenaline, histamine, morphine.\n\nCompetitive antagonists have affinity but no intrinsic activity (IA = 0), e.g. propranolol, atropine, chlorpheniramine, naloxone.\n\nPartial agonists have affinity and submaximal intrinsic activity (IA between 0 and 1), e.g. dichloroisoproterenol (on \u03b2 adrenergic receptor), buspirone on 5-HT1A receptor.\n\nThe lower ceiling response to a partial agonist is not because of lower affinity for the receptor. In fact some partial agonists have higher affinity and are dose-to-dose more potent than the full agonist, e.g. buprenorphine is 25 times more potent than morphine (full agonist of m opioid receptor) but is a partial agonist and cannot relieve very severe pain or deeply depress respiration.", "start_char_idx": 12727, "end_char_idx": 17065, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d5b1f8f5-2e52-47c1-b459-3e6c935e32af": {"__data__": {"id_": "d5b1f8f5-2e52-47c1-b459-3e6c935e32af", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_4.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_4.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 35220, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "126e6ea9-0fe4-4748-9932-0355ce609a2b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_4.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_4.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 35220, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "02e0773500ee3030eaf8f83ff7b7c90cbc8f8b3acd73bc764f75ac039d7dfa55", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "52966ef4-202e-4e8d-ad2b-44dbbda2f82d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_4.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_4.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 35220, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "ca60ced17d0af80601e83be071e17c98fa138d23a6f908e101dcf31108135701", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ef2e0fde-216b-4fe6-94b5-4799ac840abc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "43b561e25d62ba0e70f22881305d8d914ee0ef7ffd29cf4d634fd55404afde66", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "adrenaline, histamine, morphine.\n\nCompetitive antagonists have affinity but no intrinsic activity (IA = 0), e.g. propranolol, atropine, chlorpheniramine, naloxone.\n\nPartial agonists have affinity and submaximal intrinsic activity (IA between 0 and 1), e.g. dichloroisoproterenol (on \u03b2 adrenergic receptor), buspirone on 5-HT1A receptor.\n\nThe lower ceiling response to a partial agonist is not because of lower affinity for the receptor. In fact some partial agonists have higher affinity and are dose-to-dose more potent than the full agonist, e.g. buprenorphine is 25 times more potent than morphine (full agonist of m opioid receptor) but is a partial agonist and cannot relieve very severe pain or deeply depress respiration.\n\nPartial agonists also antagonize the effects of a full agonist, because they occupy a large population of the receptors (while producing small response) and leave fewer receptors to interact with the full agonist. As such, buprenorphine precipitates withdrawal symptoms in a highly morphine dependent subject, but can substitute for it at lower levels of morphine dependence.\n\nInverse agonists have affinity but intrinsic activity with a minus sign (IA between 0 and \u20131). Inverse agonism is manifest only in case of some receptors which show certain degree of Constitutive activation, i.e. they are partially active even in the basal state (complete absence of any agonist). In other words they are tonically active. The benzodiazepine receptor (see Fig. 29.3) is one such\u00a0 receptor, and DMCM is its inverse agonist. However, majority of receptors (like the NM nicotinic receptor) are totally inactive in the absence of an agonist, and there is no scope for inverse agonism.\n\nIt has also been demonstrated that many full agonists can produce maximal response even while occupying <1% of the available receptors. A large receptor reserve exists in their case, or a number of spare receptors are present. On the other hand, for certain drugs, the total number of receptors may limit the maximal response, and there are no space receptors.\n\nThe two-state receptor model\n\nAn attractive alternative model for explaining the action of agonists, antagonists, partial agonists and inverse agonists has been proposed.\n\nThe receptor is believed to exist in two interchangeable states: Ra (active) and Ri (inactive) which are in equilibrium. In the case of majority of receptors, the Ri state is favoured at equilibrium\u2014no/very weak signal is generated in the absence of the agonist\u2014the receptor exhibits no constitutive activation (Fig. 4.3I). The agonist (A) binds preferentially to the Ra conformation and shifts the equilibrium \u2192 Ra predominates and a response is generated (Fig. 4.3II) depending on the concentration of A. The competitive antagonist (B) binds to Ra and Ri with equal affinity \u2192 the equilibrium is not altered \u2192 no response is generated (Fig. 4.3 III), and when the agonist is applied fewer Ra are available to bind it\u2014response to agonist is decreased. If an agonist has only slightly greater affinity for Ra than for Ri, the equilibrium is only\u00a0 modestly shifted towards Ra (Fig. 4.3 IV) even at saturating concentrations \u2192 a submaximal response is produced and the drug is called a partial agonist (C). The inverse agonist (D) has high affinity for the Ri state (Fig. 4.3V), therefore it can produce an opposite response, provided the resting equilibrium was in favour of the Ra state. Certain ion channel receptors such as benzodiazepine receptor and some G-protein coupled receptors like histamine H2, angiotensin AT1, adrenergic \u03b21 and cannabinoid receptors exhibit constitutive activation, i.e. an appreciable intensity signal is generated even in the basal state (no agonist present). In their case the inverse agonist stabilizes the receptor in the inactive conformation resulting in an opposite response. Only few inverse agonists are known at present. \n\nThis model provides an explanation for the phenomenon of positive cooperativity often seen with neurotransmitters, and is supported by studies of conformational mutants of the receptor with altered equilibrium.

However, receptors are now known to be capable of adopting not just two, but multiple active and inactive conformations favoured by different ligands. \n\nNature of receptors\n\nReceptors are regulatory macromolecules, mostly proteins, though nucleic acids may also serve as receptors. Hundreds of receptor proteins have been isolated, purified, cloned and their primary amino acid (AA) sequence has been worked out. Molecular cloning has also helped in obtaining the receptor protein in larger quantity to study its structure and properties, and in subclassifying receptors. The cell surface receptors with their coupling and effector proteins are considered to be floating in a sea of membrane lipids; the folding, orientation and topography of the system being determined by interactions between the lipophilic and hydrophilic domains of the peptide chains with solvent molecules (water on one side and lipids on the other). Nonpolar portions of the AA chain tend to bury within the membrane, while polar groups tend to come out in the aqueous medium. In such a delicately balanced system, it is not difficult to visualize that a small molecular ligand binding to one site in the receptor molecule could be capable of tripping the balance (by altering distribution of charges, etc.) and bringing about conformational changes at distant sites. Each of the five major families of receptors (described later) have a well defined common structural motif, while the individual receptors differ in the details of amino acid sequencing, length of intra/extracellular loops, etc. Majority of receptor molecules are made up of several non-identical subunits (heteropolymeric), and agonist binding has been shown to bring about changes in their quaternary structure or relative alignment of the subunits, e.g. on activation the subunits of nicotinic receptor move apart opening a centrally located cation channel.\n\n \n\nMany clinically useful drugs act upon physiological receptors which mediate responses to transmitters, hormones, autacoids and other endogenous signal molecules; examples are cholinergic, adrenergic, histaminergic, steroid, leukotriene, insulin and other such receptors. In addition, now some truly drug receptors have been described for which there are no known physiological ligands, e.g. benzodiazepine receptor, sulfonylurea receptor.\u00a0 Receptors for which no endogenous mediator or ligand is at present known are called \u2018Orphan receptors\u2019. They, nevertheless, may prove to be targets for novel drugs yet to be developed.\n\nReceptor subtypes\n\nThe delineation of multiple types and subtypes of receptors for signal molecules has played an important role in the development of a number of targeted and more selective drugs. Even at an early stage of evolution of receptor pharmacology, it was observed that actions of acetylcholine could be grouped into \u2018muscarinic\u2019 and \u2018nicotinic\u2019 depending upon whether they were mimicked by the then known alkaloids muscarine or nicotine. Accordingly, they were said to be mediated by two types of cholinergic receptors, viz. muscarinic (M) or nicotinic (N); a concept strengthened by the finding that muscarinic actions were blocked by atropine, while nicotinic actions were blocked by curare. In a landmark study, Ahlquist (1948) divided adrenergic receptors into \u2018\u03b1\u2019 and \u2018\u03b2\u2019 on the basis of two distinct rankorder of potencies of adrenergic agonists. These receptors have now been further subdivided (M1, M2 \u2026.M5), (NM, NN) (\u03b11, \u03b12) (\u03b21, \u03b22, \u03b23). Multiple subtypes of receptors for practically all transmitters, autacoids, hormones, etc. are now known and have paved the way for introduction of numerous clinically superior drugs.

Multiple 5-HT receptors were distinguished by this approach. Autoradiography has helped in mapping distribution of receptor subtypes in the brain and other organs.\n\nd.Transducer pathway Receptor subtypes may be distinguished by the mechanism through which their activation is linked to the response, e.g. M cholinergic receptor acts through G-proteins, while N cholinergic receptor gates influx of Na+ ions; \u03b1 adrenergic receptor acts via IP3-DAG pathway and by decreasing camp, while \u03b2 adrenergic receptor increases cAMP; GABAA receptor is a ligand gated Cl\u2013 channel, while GABAB receptor increases K+ conductance through a G-protein.\n\ne.Molecular cloning The receptor protein is cloned and its detailed amino acid sequence as well as three dimentional structure is worked out. Subtypes are designated on the basis of sequence homology. This approach has in the recent years resulted in a flood of receptor subtypes and several isoforms (which do not differ in ligand selectivity) of each subtype. The functional significance of many of these subtypes/isoforms is dubious. Even receptors without known ligands (orphan receptors) have been described.\n\nApplication of so many approaches has thrown up several detailed, confusing and often conflicting classifications of receptors in the past. However, a consensus receptor classification is now decided on a continuing basis by an expert group of the International Union of Pharmacological Sciences (IUPHAR).\n\nSilent receptors These are sites which bind specific drugs but no pharmacological response is elicited. They are better called inert binding sites or sites of loss, e.g. plasma proteins which have binding sites for many drugs. To avoid confusion, the term receptor should be restricted to those regulatory binding sites which are capable of generating a response.\n\nACTION-EFFECT SEQUENCE\n\n\u2018Drug action\u2019 and \u2018drug effect\u2019 are often loosely used interchangeably, but are not synonymous.\n\nDrug action It is the initial combination of the drug with its receptor resulting in a conformational change in the latter (in case of agonists), or prevention of conformational change through exclusion of the agonist (in case of antagonists).\n\nDrug effect It is the ultimate change in biological function brought about as a consequence of drug action, through a series of intermediate steps (transducer).\n\nReceptors subserve two essential functions, viz, recognition of the specific ligand molecule and transduction of the signal into a response. Accordingly, the receptor molecule has a ligand binding domain (spatially and energetically suitable for binding the specific ligand) and an effector domain (Fig.\u00a0 4.4) which undergoes a functional conformational change. These domains have now actually been identified in some receptors. The perturbation in the receptor molecule is variously translated into the response.

The sequential relationship between drug action, transducer and drug effect can be seen in Fig. 4.1D and 4.6.\n\nTransducer Mechanisms\n\nConsiderable progress has been made in the understanding of transducer mechanisms which in most instances have been found to be highly complex multistep processes that provide for amplification of the signal, as well as integration of concurrently received extra- and intra-cellular signals at each step. Because only a handful of transducer pathways are shared by a large number of receptors, the cell is able to generate an integrated response reflecting the sum total of diverse signal inputs. The transducer mechanisms can be grouped into 5 major categories. Receptors falling in one category also possess considerable structural homology, and belong to one super-family of receptors.\n\n1. G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs)\u00a0 \n\nThese are a large family of cell membrane receptors which are linked to the effector (enzyme/channel/transporter) through one or more GTP-activated proteins (G-proteins) for response effectuation. All such receptors have a common pattern of structural organization (Fig. 4.5). The molecule has 7 \u03b1-helical membrane spanning hydrophobic amino acid (AA) segments which run into 3 extracellular and 3 intracellular loops. The agonist binding site is located somewhere between the helices on the extracellular face, while another recognition site formed by cytosolic segments binds the coupling G-protein. The G-proteins float in the membrane with their exposed domain lying in the cytosol, and are heterotrimeric in composition (\u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3\u00a0 subunits). In the inactive state GDP is bound to the \u03b1 subunit\u00a0 at the exposed domain; activation through the receptor leads to displacement of GDP by GTP. The activated \u03b1-subunit carrying GTP dissociates from the other two subunits and either activates or inhibits the effector.

Moreover, a receptor can utilize different biochemical pathways in different tissues.\n\nThe \u03b1-subunit has GTPase activity: the bound GTP is slowly hydrolysed to GDP: the \u03b1-subunit then dissociates from the effector to rejoin its other subunits, but not before the effector has been activated/inhibited for several seconds (much longer than the life-time of the activated receptor, which is in milliseconds) and the signal has been greatly amplified. The rate of GTP hydrolysis by the \u03b1 subunit and thus the period for which it remains activated is regulated by another protein called \u2018regulator of G protein signaling\u2019 (RGS). The onset time of response through GPCRs is in seconds.\n\nThere are three major effector pathways (Table 4.1) through which GPCRs function.\n\n(a) Adenylyl cyclase: cAMP pathway Activation of AC results in intracellular accumulation of second messenger cAMP (Fig. 4.6) which functions mainly through cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). The PKA phosphorylates and alters the function of many enzymes, ion channels, transporters, transcription factors and structural proteins to manifest as increased contractility/impulse generation (heart), relaxation (smooth muscle), glycogenolysis, lipolysis, inhibition of secretion/mediator release, modulation of junctional transmission, water conservation by kidney, steroid hormone synthesis, etc. In addition, cAMP directly opens a specific type of membrane Ca2+ channel called cyclic nucleotide gated channel (CNG) in the heart, brain and kidney. The other mediators of cellular actions of cAMP are: cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) which is a transcription factor, cAMP regulated guanine nucleotide exchange factors called EPACs and certain transporters. Responses opposite to the above are produced when AC is inhibited through inhibitory Gi-protein.\n\nThe action of cAMP is terminated intracellularly by phosphodiesterases (PDEs) which hydrolyse it to 5-AMP. Some isoforms of PDE (PDE3, PDE4) are selective for cAMP, while PDE5 is selective for cGMP.\n\nCyclic GMP (cGMP) as a second messenger\n\n\n\nTable 4.1: Major functional pathways of G-protein coupled receptor transduction\n\nAdenylyl cyclase: cAMP\n\nPhospholipase\u2014IP3/DAG\n\nChannel regulation\n\nactivation\n\ninhibition\n\nactivation\n\nCa2+ opening\n\nCa2+ closing\n\nK+ opening\n\nAdrenergic-\u03b2\n\nAdrenergic-\u03b12\n\nAdrenergic-\u03b11\n\nAdrenergic-\u03b21\n\nDopamine-D2\n\nAdrenergic-\u03b12\n\nHistamine-H2\n\nMuscarinic-M2\n\nHistamine-H1\n\n\n\nGABAB\n\nMuscarinic-M2\n\nDopamine-D1\n\nDopamine-D2\n\nMuscarinic-M1, M3\n\n\n\nOpioid-\u03ba\n\nDopamine-D2\n\nGlucagon\n\n5-HT1\n\n5-HT2", "start_char_idx": 29768, "end_char_idx": 33567, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6778cd98-de5c-4a72-87df-a2f225afaa23": {"__data__": {"id_": "6778cd98-de5c-4a72-87df-a2f225afaa23", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_4.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_4.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 35220, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "126e6ea9-0fe4-4748-9932-0355ce609a2b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_4.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_4.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 35220, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "02e0773500ee3030eaf8f83ff7b7c90cbc8f8b3acd73bc764f75ac039d7dfa55", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f44c87b0-468e-45bf-a7f2-4a847bf5c058", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_4.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_4.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 35220, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "c788f35847acc1983efbc3d73b35e4bde75fd8f12850c2d5d7d49d6525fa77f8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "55386f4b-e601-4584-bffe-cf6c8f17a01e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "06919a6cc3580ec97cc02733e12071e190e5d1b5a9ddfadeee5d48f8d4f77b06", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Table 4.1: Major functional pathways of G-protein coupled receptor transduction\n\nAdenylyl cyclase: cAMP\n\nPhospholipase\u2014IP3/DAG\n\nChannel regulation\n\nactivation\n\ninhibition\n\nactivation\n\nCa2+ opening\n\nCa2+ closing\n\nK+ opening\n\nAdrenergic-\u03b2\n\nAdrenergic-\u03b12\n\nAdrenergic-\u03b11\n\nAdrenergic-\u03b21\n\nDopamine-D2\n\nAdrenergic-\u03b12\n\nHistamine-H2\n\nMuscarinic-M2\n\nHistamine-H1\n\n\n\nGABAB\n\nMuscarinic-M2\n\nDopamine-D1\n\nDopamine-D2\n\nMuscarinic-M1, M3\n\n\n\nOpioid-\u03ba\n\nDopamine-D2\n\nGlucagon\n\n5-HT1\n\n5-HT2\n\n\n\nAdenosine-A1\n\n5-HT1A\n\nFSH & LH\n\nGABAB\n\nVasopressin-Oxytocin\n\n\n\nSomatostatin\n\nGABAB\n\nACTH\n\nOpioid-\u00b5, \u03b4\n\nBradykinin-B2\n\n\n\n\n\nOpioid-\u00b5, \u03b4\n\nTSH\n\nAngiotensin-AT1\n\nAngiotensin-AT1\n\n\n\n\n\nAdenosine-A1\n\nProstaglandin-EP2\n\nProstaglandin-EP3\n\nProstaglandin-FP, EP1, EP3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProstacyclin-IP\n\nSomatostatin\n\nThromboxane-TP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdenosine-A2\n\nAdenosine-A1\n\nLeukotriene BLT, cys LT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCholecystokinin-Gastrin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPAF\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast to cAMP, the cGMP serves as an intracellular second messenger only in a limited number of tissues, such as vascular smooth muscle, intestinal mucosal cell and kidney. In these tissues it respectively mediates relaxation, inhibition of salt and water absorption as well as anion secretion, and natriuresis (mainly due to reduced proximal tubular Na+ reabsorption). \n\nThere are two principal forms of guanylyl cyclases (GC) which generate cGMP, one cell membrane bound and the other cytosolic. However, none of these is regulated by a GPCR. The cell membrane bound GC is regulated by a transmembrane enzyme-linked receptor (described on p.58) for atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). The cytosolic soluble GC in vascular smooth muscle is activated\u00a0 by nitric oxide (NO). After generation by the vascular endothelium no diffuses into the adjacent smooth muscle cell and stimulates the soluble GC. Increased cGmp dephosphorylates myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) through PKG and induces relaxation (see Fig. 40.3). This pathway is utilized by glyceryl trinitrate, sod. nitroprusside, etc.\n\n(b) Phospholipase C: IP3-DAG pathway Activation of phospholipase C\u03b2 (PLc\u03b2) by the activated GTP carrying \u03b1 subunit of Gq hydrolyses the membrane phospholipid phosphatidyl inositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to generate the second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). The IP3 being water soluble diffuses to the cytosol and mobilizes Ca2+ from endoplasmic reticular depots (Fig. 4.7). The lipophilic DAG remains within the membrane, but recruits protein kinase C (PKc) and activates it with the help of Ca2+. The activated PKc phosphorylates many intracellular proteins (depending\u00a0 on the type of effector cell) and mediates various physiological responses. So that it can serve signaling functions, the cytosolic concentration of Ca2+ is kept very low (~ 100 nM) by specific pumps located at the plasma membrane and at the endoplasmic reticulum. Triggered by IP3, the released Ca2+ (third messenger in this setting) acts as a highly versatile regulator acting through calmodulin (CAM), PKc and other effectors\u2014mediates/modulates smooth muscle, contraction, glandular secretion/transmitter release, eicosanoid synthesis, neuronal excitability, intracellular movements, membrane function, metabolism, cell proliferation, etc. Signaling in this pathway is terminated by degradation of the second messengers.", "start_char_idx": 33097, "end_char_idx": 36430, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "55386f4b-e601-4584-bffe-cf6c8f17a01e": {"__data__": {"id_": "55386f4b-e601-4584-bffe-cf6c8f17a01e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_4.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_4.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 35220, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "126e6ea9-0fe4-4748-9932-0355ce609a2b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_4.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_4.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 35220, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "02e0773500ee3030eaf8f83ff7b7c90cbc8f8b3acd73bc764f75ac039d7dfa55", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6778cd98-de5c-4a72-87df-a2f225afaa23", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_4.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_4.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 35220, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "ecd0e0df09281bef7d802cb79885ba5329dc7a07c5db9a75efa19c39754a0534", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "26560334-a3d7-44cf-b066-48f96b59f0b1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "de03c0fb6accd0e7f15045e892d79ecdb4b87d68435bd2b2e161e7567f296607", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The activated PKc phosphorylates many intracellular proteins (depending\u00a0 on the type of effector cell) and mediates various physiological responses.

Thus, the same intracellular messenger can trigger different responses depending on the nature and strength of the extracellular signal.\n\n(c) Channel regulation The activated G-proteins (Gs, Gi, Go) can also open or inhibit ionic channels specific for Ca2+ and K+, without the intervention of any second messenger like cAMP or IP3, and bring about hyperpolarization/depolarization/changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration. The Gs opens Ca2+ channels in myocardium and skeletal muscles, while Gi and Go open K+ channels in heart and smooth muscle as well as inhibit neuronal Ca2+ channels. Direct channel regulation is mostly the function of the \u03b2\u03b3 dimer of the dissociated G protein. Physiological responses like changes in inotropy, chronotropy, transmitter release, neuronal activity and smooth muscle relaxation follow. Receptors found to regulate ionic channels through G-proteins are listed in Table 4.1.\n\n2. Ion channel receptors \n\nThese cell surface receptors, also called ligand gated ion channels, enclose ion selective channels (for Na+, K+, Ca2+ or Cl\u00af) within their molecules. Agonist binding opens the channel (Fig. 4.4) and causes depolarization/hyperpolarization/changes in cytosolic ionic composition, depending on the ion that flows through. The nicotinic cholinergic, GABAA, glycine (inhibitory AA), excitatory AA-glutamate (kainate, NMDA and AMPA) and 5HT3 receptors fall in this category, and a large number of clinically useful drugs act through this type of receptors.\n\nThe receptor is usually a pentameric protein; all subunits, in addition to large intra- and extracellular segments, generally have four membrane spanning helical domains. The subunits are mostly arranged round the channel like a rosette and the \u03b1 subunits usually bear the agonist binding sites.\n\nCertain receptor-operated (or ligand-gated) ion channels also have secondary ligands which bind to an allosteric site and modulate the gating of the channel by the primary ligand, e.g. the benzodiazepine receptor modulates GABAA gated Cl\u00af channel.\n\nThus, in these receptors the agonist directly operates ion channels, without the intervention of any coupling protein or second messenger. The onset and offset of responses through this class of receptors is the fastest (in milliseconds).\n\n3. Transmembrane enzyme-linked receptors\n\nThis class of receptors are utilized primarily by peptide hormones, and are made up of a large extracellular ligand binding domain connected through a single transmembrane helical peptide chain to an intracellular subunit having enzymatic property. The enzyme at the cytosolic side is generally a protein kinase, but can also be guanylyl cyclase in few cases. The commonest protein kinases are the ones which phosphorylate tyrosine residues on the substrate proteins and are called \u2018receptor tyrosine kinases\u2019 (RTKs), see Fig. 4.8.

The enzyme at the cytosolic side is generally a protein kinase, but can also be guanylyl cyclase in few cases.

Examples are\u2014insulin, epidermal growth factor (EGF), nerve growth factor (NGF) and many other growth factor receptors. Inhibitors of specific RTKs involved in growth factor signaling are a new class of targeted anticancer drugs. However, the transforming growth factor (TGF) receptor and few others are serine/threonine kinases\u2014which phosphorylate serine/threonine residues of the target proteins. \n\n \n\nIn the unliganded monomeric state, the kinase remains inactive. Hormone binding induces dimerization of receptor molecules, brings about conformation changes which activate the kinase to autophosphorylate tyrosine residues on each other, increasing their affinity for binding substrate proteins which have SH2 domains. These are then phosphorylated and released to carry forward the cascade of phosphorylations leading to the response. \n\nA large number of intracellular signaling proteins have SH2 domains. Thus, by controlling phosphorylation of key enzymes, ion channels, transporters, etc. the RTKs are able to regulate diverse cellular functions including metabolic reactions, cell growth and differentiation. One of the SH2 domain enzymes is phospholipase c\u03b3 (PLc\u03b3) which is activated by certain RTKs, and which, like PLc\u03b2, generates IP3 and DAG as second messengers for response effectuation. \n\nThe transmembrane enzyme-linked receptors transduce responses in a matter of few minutes to few hours. \n\nAnother feature of this class of receptors is that their dimerization also promotes receptor internalization, degradation in lysosomes and down regulation if activation is fast enough. Mutations interfering with such down-regulation contribute to development of certain malignancies.\n\nIn place of protein kinase the enzyme can also be guanylyl cyclase (GC), as in the case of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). Agonist activation of the receptor generates cGMP in the cytosol as a second messenger, which in turn activates cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) and modulates cellular activity.\n\n \n\n4. Transmembrane JAK-STAT binding receptors\n\nThese receptors differ from RTKs in not having any intrinsic catalytic domain. Agonist-induced dimerization alters the intracellular domain conformation to increase its affinity for a cytosolic tyrosine protein kinase JAK (Janus Kinase). On binding, JAK gets activated and phosphorylates tyrosine residues of the receptor, which now bind another free moving protein STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription). This is also phosphorylated by JAK. Pairs of phosphorylated STAT dimerize and translocate to the nucleus to regulate gene transcription resulting in a biological response. Many cytokines, growth hormone, prolactin, interferons, etc. act through this type of receptor.\n\n5.Receptors regulating gene expression (Transcription factors, Nuclear receptors) \n\nIn contrast to the above 4 classes of receptors, these are intracellular (cytoplasmic or nuclear) soluble proteins which respond to lipid soluble chemical messengers that penetrate the cell (Fig. 4.10). The receptor protein (specific for each hormone/regulator) is inherently capable of binding to specific genes, but its attached proteins HSP-90 and may be some others prevent it from adopting the configuration needed for binding to DNA. When the hormone binds near the carboxy terminus of the receptor, the restricting proteins (HSP-90, etc.) are released, the receptor dimerizes and the DNA binding regulatory segment located in the middle of the molecule folds into the functionally active configuration. The liganded receptor dimer moves to the nucleus and binds other co-activator/co-repressor proteins which have a modulatory influence on its capacity to alter gene function. The whole complex then attaches to specific DNA sequences (hormone response elements) of the target genes and facilitates or represses their expression so that specific mRNA is synthesized/repressed on the template of the gene.", "start_char_idx": 39163, "end_char_idx": 43774, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "67118166-13fa-4fc5-b9a3-8b4299dfd130": {"__data__": {"id_": "67118166-13fa-4fc5-b9a3-8b4299dfd130", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_4.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_4.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 35220, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "126e6ea9-0fe4-4748-9932-0355ce609a2b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_4.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_4.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 35220, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "02e0773500ee3030eaf8f83ff7b7c90cbc8f8b3acd73bc764f75ac039d7dfa55", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "26560334-a3d7-44cf-b066-48f96b59f0b1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_4.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_4.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 35220, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "332c8618e022324c7c431d0daf3bd4b0516bec7125f5779bae9d9c391ee77246", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8a50c442-fc28-4e94-b430-2045b0b7d3a8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "95ba1acb802bd5cb33cef09891e7318f6293964aefd188627654c83b9a037fc0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "4.10).

The whole complex then attaches to specific DNA sequences (hormone response elements) of the target genes and facilitates or represses their expression so that specific mRNA is synthesized/repressed on the template of the gene. This mRNA moves to the ribosomes and directs synthesis of specific proteins which regulate activity of the target cells. \n\nAll steroidal hormones (glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, androgens, estrogens, progesterone), thyroxine, vit D and vit A function in this manner. Different steroidal hormones affect different target cells and produce different effects because each one binds to its own receptor and directs a unique pattern of synthesis of specific proteins. The specificity as to which hormone will be bound is provided by the hormone binding domain, while that as to which gene will be activated or repressed is a function of the DNA binding/N-terminus domain. Different ligands of the same nuclear receptor have been found to induce ligand-specific conformations of the receptor so that different combinations of co-activators and co-repressors may be bound in different target tissues, e.g. selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) tamoxifen and raloxifene have differing patterns of action on various estrogenic target organs. Chimeric receptors have also been produced which respond to one hormone, but produce the effects of the other hormone. \n\nThis transduction mechanism is the slowest in its time course of action (takes hours) because adequate quantity of the effector protein will have to be produced before the response occurs. The effects also generally out last the signal (hormone), because majority of the generated effector proteins have slow turnover, and persist in the body even after the hormone has been eliminated. \n\nRegulation of receptors\n\nReceptors exist in a dynamic state; their density and efficacy to elicit the response is subject to regulation by the level of on-going activity, feedback from their own signal output and other physiopathological influences, e.g. estrogens increase the density of oxytocin receptors on the myometrium. The sensitivity of uterus to contractile action of oxytocin increases progressively during the third trimester of pregnancy, especially near term. In tonically active systems, prolonged deprivation of the agonist (by denervation or continued use of an antagonist or a drug which reduces input) results in supersensitivity of the receptor as well as the effector system to the agonist. This has clinical relevance in clonidine/CNS depressant/opioid withdrawal syndromes, sudden discontinuation of propranolol in angina pectoris, etc. The mechanisms involved may be unmasking of receptors or their proliferation (up regulation) or accentuation of signal amplification by the transducer.\n\n\n\nConversely, continued/intense receptor stimulation causes desensitization or refractoriness: the receptor becomes less efficient in transducing response to the agonist. This can be easily demonstrated experimentally (Fig. 4.11); clinical examples are bronchial asthma patients treated continuously with \u03b2 adrenergic agonists and parkinsonian patients treated with high doses of levodopa gradually become less responsive. The changes may be brought about by:\n\n(i) Masking or internalization of the receptor (it becomes inaccessible to the agonist) or impaired coupling of the transducer to the receptor. In this case refractoriness develops as well as fades quickly.\n\nIn the case of \u03b2 adrenergic receptor, it has been found that high rate of agonist binding promotes phosphorylation of its serine residues near the intracellular carboxy terminus by an enzyme \u03b2 adrenergic receptor kinase (\u03b2ARK), allowing it to bind a protein called \u03b2-arrestin (\u03b2\u2212arr) which hinders its interaction with Gs \u2192 receptor transduction is impaired.

However, in case of excessive/prolonged activation, the phosphorylated \u03b2 adrenergic GPCR is internalized and largely moved to the lysosomes, where they are degraded, rather than returning back to the surface membrane. This results in receptor down regulation.\n\n(ii) Decreased synthesis/increased destruction of the receptor (down regulation): refractoriness develops over weeks or months and recedes slowly. Receptor down regulation is particularly exhibited by the tyrosine kinase receptors and some GPCRs. Similarly, the transducer and effector proteins are also up or down regulated. \n\nSome times response to all agonists which act through different receptors but produce the same overt effect (e.g. histamine and acetylcholine both contract intestinal smooth muscle) is decreased by exposure to any one of these agonists (heterologous desensitization), showing that mechanisms of response effectuation have become less efficient. However, often desensitization is limited to agonists of the same receptor that is being repeatedly activated (homologous desensitization).\n\nBoth homologous and heterologous desensitization has been observed in the case of GPCRs. The BARK \u03b2-arrestin mechanism described above produces homologous desensitization. The GPCRs transduce many responses by activating PKA and PKC. These kinases phosphorylate many GPCRs rather nonselectively (at a site different from that of BARK) and hinder their interaction with G-proteins, resulting in heterologous desensitization.\n\nFunctions of receptors\n\nThese can be summarized as:\n\n \n\n(a) To propagate regulatory signals from outside to inside the effector cell when the molecular species carrying the signal cannot itself penetrate the cell membrane.\n\n(b) To amplify the signal.\n\n(c) To integrate various extracellular and intracellular regulatory signals.\n\n(d) To adapt to short term and long term changes in the regulatory melieu and maintain homeostasis.\n\nNonreceptor-mediated drug action\n\nThis refers to drugs which do not act by binding to specific regulatory macromolecules. Drug action by purely physical or chemical means, interactions with small molecules or ions (antacids, chelating agents, cholestyramine, etc.), as well as direct interaction with enzymes, ionic channels and transporters has already been described. In addition, there are drugs like alkylating agents which react covalently with several critical biomolecules, especially nucleic acids, and have cytotoxic property useful in the treatment of cancer. Another important class of drugs are the antimetabolites (purine/pyrimidine analogues) which lead to production of nonfunctional or dysfunctional cellular components that exert antineoplastic, antiviral and immunosuppressant activity.\n\nDose-response relationship\n\nWhen a drug is administered systemically, the dose-response relationship has two components: dose-plasma concentration relationship and plasma concentration-response relationship. The former is determined by pharmacokinetic considerations and ordinarily, descriptions of dose-response relationship refer to the latter, which can be more easily studied in vitro.\n\nGenerally, the intensity of response increases with increase in dose (or more precisely concentration at the receptor), but at higher doses, the increase in response progressively becomes less marked and the dose-response curve is a rectangular hyperbola (Fig. 4.12).

This is not peculiar to drugs. In fact all stimuli are graded biologically by the fractional change in stimulus intensity, e.g. 1 kg and 2 kg weights held in two hands can be easily differentiated, but not 10 kg and 11 kg weights. Though the absolute difference in both cases remains 1 kg, there is a 100% fractional change in the former case but only 10% change in the latter case. In other words, response is proportional to an exponential function (log) of the dose.\n\nOther advantages of plotting log dose-response curves (DRC) are:\n\n\u2022A wide range of drug doses can be easily displayed on a graph.\n\n\u2022Comparison between agonists and study of antagonists becomes easier.\n\nThe log dose-response curve (DRC) can be characterized by its shape (slope and maxima) and position on the dose axis.\n\n \n\nDrug potency and efficacy\n\nThe position of DRC on the dose axis is the index of drug potency which refers to the amount of drug needed to produce a certain response. A DRC positioned rightward indicates lower potency (Fig. 4.13). Relative potency is often more meaningful than absolute potency, and is generally defined by comparing the dose (concentration) of the two agonists at which they elicit half maximal response (EC50). Thus, if 10 mg of morphine = 100 mg of pethidine as analgesic, morphine is 10 times more potent than pethidine. However, a higher potency, in itself, does not confer clinical superiority unless the potency for therapeutic effect is selectively increased over potency for adverse effect. Drug potency is clearly a factor in choosing the dose of a drug.\n\nThe upper limit of DRC is the index of drug efficacy and refers to the maximal response that can be elicited by the drug, e.g. morphine produces a degree of analgesia not obtainable with any dose of aspirin\u2014morphine is more efficacious than aspirin. Efficacy is a more decisive factor in the choice of a drug.\n\nOften the terms \u2018drug potency\u2019 and \u2018drug efficacy\u2019 are used interchangeably, but these are not synonymous and refer to different characteristics of the drug. The two can vary independently:\n\n(a) Aspirin is less potent as well as less efficacious analgesic than morphine.\n\n(b) Pethidine is less potent but equally efficacious analgesic as morphine.\n\n(c) Furosemide is less potent but more efficacious diuretic than metolazone.\n\n(d) Diazepam is more potent but less efficacious CNS depressant than pentobarbitone.\n\nDepending on the type of drug, both higher efficacy (as in the case of furosemide confering utility for mobilizing edema fluid and in renal failure) or lower efficacy (as in the case of diazepam confering safety in over-dose) could be clinically advantageous.\n\nThe slope of the DRC is also important. A steep slope indicates that a moderate increase in dose will markedly increase the response (dose needs individualization), while a flat one implies that little increase in response will occur over a wide dose range (standard doses can be given to most patients). Hydralazine has a steep, while hydrochlorothiazide has a flat DRC of antihypertensive effect (Fig. 4.14).\n\nTherapeutic efficacy \n\nThe \u2018therapeutic efficacy\u2019 or \u2018clinical effectiveness\u2019 is a composite attribute of a drug different from the foregoing pharmacological description of \u2018potency\u2019 and \u2018efficacy\u2019.", "start_char_idx": 50469, "end_char_idx": 54912, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4f748fc3-16ac-49b7-8736-ce2812373fff": {"__data__": {"id_": "4f748fc3-16ac-49b7-8736-ce2812373fff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_4.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_4.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 35220, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "126e6ea9-0fe4-4748-9932-0355ce609a2b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_4.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_4.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 35220, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "02e0773500ee3030eaf8f83ff7b7c90cbc8f8b3acd73bc764f75ac039d7dfa55", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ed048b8a-beca-4aa1-9836-07a4283b9226", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_4.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_4.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 35220, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "3a6cdda66cd504846c9a60490bbf51dcadb166b5a0ccd7d04c9abf32e9f84432", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d2c5944b-bb35-44ba-a742-4abf6156d8b0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5eb467a7015c3f41efd8c9ea6f83f96789cd6f1c9ad7c18da52fb861a7537cc5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Depending on the type of drug, both higher efficacy (as in the case of furosemide confering utility for mobilizing edema fluid and in renal failure) or lower efficacy (as in the case of diazepam confering safety in over-dose) could be clinically advantageous.\n\nThe slope of the DRC is also important.

It depends not only on the relative potency and efficacy of the drug, but on many pharmacokinetic and pathophysiological variables as well. It is often expressed in terms of (a) degree of benefit/relief afforded by the drug (in the recommended dose range) i.e. graded dose-response relationship. For example, the degree of relief in parkinsonian symptoms afforded by levodopa-carbidopa is much greater than that possible with trihexyphenidyl: the former has higher therapeutic efficacy than the latter.\n\nThe other method of expressing therapeutic efficacy is in terms of (b) success rate in achieving a defined therapeutic end point, i.e. quantal dose-response relationship, e.g. an antibiotic which cures 95% cases of gonorrhoea is a more efficacious antigonococcal drug than one which cures only 75% patients. Similarly, a drug which makes a higher percentage of epileptic patients totally seizure free than another drug, is the more therapeutically effective antiepileptic. \n\nDrug selectivity\n\nDrugs seldom produce just one action: the DRCs for different effects of a drug may be different. The extent of separation of DRCs of a drug for different effects is a measure of its selectivity, e.g. the DRCs for bronchodilatation and cardiac stimulation (Fig. 4.15) are quite similar in case of isoprenaline, but far apart in case of salbutamol\u2014the latter is a more selective bronchodilator drug.\n\nThe gap between the therapeutic effect DRC and the adverse effect DRC defines the safety margin or the therapeutic index of a drug. In experimental animals, therapeutic index is often calculated as:\n\n \n\nwhere: Median effective dose (ED50) is the dose which produces the specified effect in 50% individuals and median lethal dose (LD50) is the dose which kills 50% of the recipients.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nBut this is irrelevant in the clinical set up where the therapeutic range, also called the \u2018therapeutic window\u2019 is bounded by the dose which produces minimal therapeutic effect and the dose which produces maximal acceptable adverse effect (Fig. 4.16). Because of individual variability, the effective dose for some subjects may be toxic for others; defining the therapeutic range for many drugs is a challenging task. A drug may be capable of inducing a higher therapeutic response (have higher efficacy) but development of intolerable adverse effects may preclude use of higher doses, e.g. prednisolone in bronchial asthma.\n\nRisk-benefit ratio This term is very frequently used, and conveys a judgement on the estimated harm (adverse effects, cost, inconvenience) vs expected advantages (relief of symptoms, cure, reduction of complications/mortality, improvement in quality of life). A drug should be prescribed only when the benefits outweigh the risks. However, risk-benefit ratio can hardly ever be accurately measured for each instance of drug use, because \u2018risk\u2019 is the probability of harm; and harm has to be qualified by its nature, quantum, time-course (transient to life-long) as well as the value that the particular patient attaches to it. None of these can be precisely ascertained beforehand in an individual patient. As such, the physician has to rely on data from use of drugs in large populations (pharmacoepidemiology) and his own experience of the drug and the patient.\n\n \n\nDrug specificity\n\nSpecificity of a drug refers to the range of actions produced by it. Certain drugs produce just one or a limited number of actions, while others have widespread effects on many organs of the body. Specificity is governed by: \n\n(a)whether a drug acts on a single receptor/target or on many targets, and \n\n(b)how widely the target is distributed in the body.", "start_char_idx": 54041, "end_char_idx": 58564, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d2c5944b-bb35-44ba-a742-4abf6156d8b0": {"__data__": {"id_": "d2c5944b-bb35-44ba-a742-4abf6156d8b0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_4.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_4.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 35220, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "126e6ea9-0fe4-4748-9932-0355ce609a2b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_4.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_4.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 35220, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "02e0773500ee3030eaf8f83ff7b7c90cbc8f8b3acd73bc764f75ac039d7dfa55", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4f748fc3-16ac-49b7-8736-ce2812373fff", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_4.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_4.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 35220, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "0cddbf81cc027598533c30af2e56cf97b1557d4f5a02cc9e1416b7a1258a619d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "16912a8b-0068-4e72-8319-41184c0273ac", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a95bbea1fb842057f1b7ffa49e151f11ee5065e84be3eeaed796c6434aaebb9a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "However, risk-benefit ratio can hardly ever be accurately measured for each instance of drug use, because \u2018risk\u2019 is the probability of harm; and harm has to be qualified by its nature, quantum, time-course (transient to life-long) as well as the value that the particular patient attaches to it.

Specificity is governed by: \n\n(a)whether a drug acts on a single receptor/target or on many targets, and \n\n(b)how widely the target is distributed in the body. \n\nOmeprazole (and other proton pump inhibitors) is an example of a highly specific drug. The singular perceptible action in therapeutic doses is inhibition of gastric acid secretion, because it acts only on one target molecule H+K+ ATPase (proton pump) which is localized to the gastric parietal cells. An example of a drug acting on multiple targets is chlorpromazine which has antagonistic action on dopamine D2, \u03b1-adrenergic, muscarinic cholinergic, histamine H1 and some 5-HT receptors. It also has Na+ channel blocking action. As a result, it produces a wide range of actions. Another case is dexamethasone which is an agonist only of glucocorticoid receptor, but produces effects involving many organs and tissues, because the glucocorticoid receptor is expressed by practically every cell of the body. Drugs with all grades of specificity are available.\u00a0 \n\nDRUG synergism and antagonism\n\nWhen two or more drugs are given simultaneously or in quick succession, they may be either indifferent to each other or exhibit synergism or antagonism. The interaction may take place at pharmacokinetic level (see Ch. 2 and 3) or at pharmacodynamic level.\n\nSYNERGISM (Greek: Syn\u2014together; ergon\u2014work)\n\nWhen the action of one drug is facilitated or increased by the other, they are said to be synergistic. In a synergistic pair, both the drugs can have action in the same direction or given alone one may be inactive but still enhance the action of the other when given together. Synergism can be:\n\n(a) Additive The effect of the two drugs is in the same direction and simply adds up:\n\neffect of drugs A + B=effect of drug A + effect of drug B\n\n \n\nAdditive drug combinations\n\n\n\nAspirin + paracetamol\n\nas analgesic/antipyretic\n\nNitrous oxide + halothane\n\nas general anaesthetic\n\nAmlodipine + atenolol\n\nas antihypertensive\n\nGlibenclamide + metformin\n\nas hypoglycaemic\n\nEphedrine + theophylline\n\nas bronchodilator\n\n\n\nSide effects of the components of an additive pair may be different\u2014do not add up. Thus, the combination is better tolerated than higher dose of one component.\n\n(b) Supraadditive (potentiation) The effect of combination is greater than the individual effects of the components:\n\neffect of drug A + B > effect of drug A + \\effect of drug B\n\nThis is always the case when one component given alone produces no effect, but enhances the effect of the other (potentiation). Examples are given in the box.

Depending on the mechanism involved, antagonism may be:\n\n(a) Physical antagonism\n\nBased on the physical property of the drugs, e.g. charcoal adsorbs alkaloids and can prevent their absorption\u2014used in alkaloidal poisonings.\n\n(b) Chemical antagonism\n\nThe two drugs react chemically and form an inactive product, e.g.\n\n\u2022KMnO4 oxidizes alkaloids\u2014used for gastric lavage in poisoning.\n\n\u2022Tannins + alkaloids\u2014insoluble alkaloidal tannate is formed.\n\n\u2022Chelating agents (BAL, Cal. disod. edetate) complex toxic metals (As, Pb).\n\n\u2022Nitrites form methaemoglobin which reacts with cyanide radical.\n\nDrugs may react when mixed in the same syringe or infusion bottle:\n\n\u2022Thiopentone sod. + succinylcholine chloride\n\n\u2022Penicillin-G sod. + succinylcholine chloride\n\n\u2022Heparin + penicillin/tetracyclines/streptomycin/hydrocortisone\n\n(c) Physiological/functional antagonism\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nThe two drugs act on different receptors or by different mechanisms, but have opposite overt effects on the same physiological function, i.e. have pharmacological effects in opposite direction, e.g.\n\n\u2022Histamine and adrenaline on bronchial muscles and on BP.\n\n\u2022Hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride on\u00a0 urinary K+ excretion.\n\n\u2022Glucagon and insulin on blood sugar level.\n\n(d) Receptor antagonism \n\nOne drug (antagonist) blocks the receptor action of the other (agonist). This is a very important mechanism of drug action, because physiological signal molecules act through their receptors, blockade of which can produce specific and often profound pharmacological effects. Receptor antagonists are selective (relatively), i.e. an anticholinergic will oppose contraction of intestinal smooth muscle induced by cholinergic agonists, but not that induced by histamine or 5-HT (they act through a different set of receptors). Receptor antagonism can be competitive or noncompetitive.\n\nCompetitive antagonism (equilibrium type) The antagonist is chemically similar to the agonist, competes with it (Fig. 4.18 A, D) and binds to the same site to the exclusion of the agonist molecules. Because the antagonist has affinity but no intrinsic activity (see p. 50), no response is produced and the log DRC of the agonist is shifted to the right. Since antagonist binding is reversible and depends on the relative concentration of the agonist and antagonist molecules, higher concentration of the agonist progressively overcomes the block\u2014a parallel shift of the agonist DRC with no suppression of maximal response is obtained (Fig. 4.19a). The extent of shift is dependent on the affinity and concentration of the antagonist.\n\nA partial agonist (Fig. 4.18 C), having affinity for the same receptor, also competes with and antagonizes a full agonist, while producing a submaximal response of its own.\n\nNoncompetitive antagonism The antagonist is chemically unrelated to the agonist, binds to a different allosteric site altering the receptor in such a way that it is unable to combine with the agonist (Fig. 4.18E), or is unable to transduce the response, so that the downstream chain of events are uncoupled. This is also called allosteric antagonism.

It requires understanding of the drug, the disease, the patient and the milieu in which it is undertaken. As such, in addition to knowledge of drug action, mechanisms and pharmacokinetics, several aspects like drug dosage, sources of variability in drug response, pharmacogenetics, influence of disease on drug action, etc. are important for otimum drug therapy.\n\nDRUG DOSAGE\n\n\u2018Dose\u2019 is the appropriate amount of a drug needed to produce a certain degree of response in a given patient.\n\nAccordingly, dose of a drug has to be qualified in terms of the chosen response, e.g. the analgesic dose of aspirin for headache is 0.3\u20130.6 g, its antiplatelet dose is 60\u2013150 mg/day, while its antiinflammatory dose for rheumatoid arthritis is 3\u20135 g per day. Similarly there could be a prophylactic dose, a therapeutic dose or a toxic dose of the same drug.\n\nThe dose of a drug is governed by its inherent potency, i.e. the concentration at which it should be present at the target site, and its pharmacokinetic characteristics. The recommended doses are based on population data and cater to an \u2018average\u2019 patient. However, individual patients may not be \u2018average\u2019 in respect to a number of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters, emphasizing the need for individualizing drug dose. The strategies adopted for different types of drugs and conditions are:\n\n1.Standard dose The same dose is appropriate for most patients\u2014individual variations are minor or the drug has a wide safety margin so that a large enough dose can be given to cover them, e.g. oral contraceptives, penicillin, chloroquine, mebendazole, hydrochlorothiazide.\n\n2.Regulated dose The drug modifies a finely regulated body function which can be easily measured. The dosage is accurately adjusted by repeated measurement of the affected physiological parameter, e.g. antihypertensives, hypoglycaemics, anticoagulants, diuretics, general anaesthetics. In their case, measurement of plasma drug concentration is not needed.\n\n3.Target level dose (see p. 41) The response is not easily measurable but has been demonstrated to be obtained at a certain range of drug concentration in plasma. An empirical dose aimed at attaining the target level is given in the beginning and adjustments are made later by actual monitoring of plasma concentrations. When facilities for drug level monitoring are not available, crude adjustments are made by observing the patient at relatively long intervals, e.g. antidepressants, antiepileptics, digoxin, theophylline.\n\n4.Titrated dose The dose needed to produce maximal therapeutic effect cannot be given because of intolerable adverse effects. Optimal dose is arrived at by titrating it with an acceptable level of adverse effect. Low initial dose and upward titration (in most non-critical situations) or high initial dose and downward titration (in critical situations) can be practised. Often a compromise between submaximal therapeutic effect but tolerable side effects can be struck, e.g. anticancer drugs, corticosteroids, levodopa.\n\nFixed dose combinations (FDCs) of drugs\n\nA large number of pharmaceutical preparations contain two or more drugs in a fixed dose ratio. Advantages offered by these are:\n\n1.Convenience and better patient compliance\u2014when all the components present in the FDC are actually needed by the patient and their amounts are appropriate. It may also be cost saving compared to both/all the components administered separately.\n\n2.Certain drug combinations are synergistic,\u00a0 e.g. sulfamethoxazole + trimethoprim; levodopa + carbidopa/benserazide; combination oral contraceptives, isoniazid + rifampin. \n\n3.The therapeutic effect of two components being same may add up while the side effects being different may not. For this the components of the FDC should act by different mechanisms, e.g. amlodipine + atenolol as antihypertensive.\n\n4.The side effect of one component may be counteracted by the other, e.g. a thiazide + a potassium sparing diuretic. However, the amount of the latter may not be sufficient in all cases.\n\n5.Combined formulation ensures that a single drug will not be administered.

However, the amount of the latter may not be sufficient in all cases.\n\n5.Combined formulation ensures that a single drug will not be administered. This is important in the treatment of tuberculosis, HIV-AIDS and falciparum malaria.\n\nBefore prescribing a combination, the physician must consider whether any of the ingredients is unnecessary; if it is, the combination should not be prescribed. It can never be justified that a drug is given to a patient who does not need it in order to provide him another, one that he needs.\n\nThere are many inbuilt disadvantages of FDCs: \n\n1.The patient may not actually need all the drugs present in a combination: he is subjected to additional side effects and expense (often due to ignorance of the physician about the exact composition of the combined formulations).\n\n2.The dose of most drugs needs to be adjusted and individualised. When a combined formulation is used, this cannot be done without altering the dose of the other component(s). However, few combinations are available at more than one dose ratios, e.g. levodopa (100 mg) + Carbidopa (10 mg or 25 mg), amoxicillin (250 mg or 500 mg) + clavulanic acid (125 mg).\n\n3.The time course of action of the components may be different: administering them at the same intervals may be inappropriate.\n\n4.Altered renal or hepatic function of the patient may differently affect the pharmacokinetics of the components.\n\n5.Adverse effect, when it occurs, cannot be easily ascribed to the particular drug causing it.\n\n6.Contraindication to one component (allergy, other conditions) contraindicates the whole product.\n\n7.Confusion of therapeutic aims and false sense of superiority of two drugs over one is fostered, specially in case of antimicrobials whose combinations should be avoided. Corticosteroids should never be combined with any other drug meant for internal use. Drug combinations that are banned in India are listed in Appendix-4.\n\nThus, only a handful of FDCs are rational and justified, while far too many are produced and vigorously promoted by the pharmaceutical industry. In fact, the latest (2017) WHO essential medicines list incorporates only 25 FDCs, and the NLEM (2015) of India has only 20 FDCs. In addition to the previously banned FDCs, recently 344 other irrational FDCs have been banned in India.\n\nFACTORS MODIFYING DRUG ACTION\n\nVariation in response to the same dose of a drug between different patients and even in the same patient on different occasions is a rule rather than exception. One or more of the following categories of differences among individuals are responsible for the variations in drug response:\n\n(1) Individuals differ in pharmacokinetic handling of drugs: attain varying plasma/target site concentration of the drug. This is more marked for drugs disposed by metabolism (e.g. propranolol) than for drugs excreted unchanged (e.g. atenolol).\n\n(2) Variations in number or state of receptors, coupling proteins or other components of response effectuation.\n\n(3) Variations in neurogenic/hormonal tone or concentrations of specific constituents, e.g. atropine tachycardia depends on vagal tone, propranolol bradycardia depends on sympathetic tone, captopril hypotension depends on body Na+ status.\n\nA multitude of host and external factors influence drug response. They fall in two categories viz genetic and nongenetic including all environmental, circumstantial and personal variables. Though individual variation cannot be totally accounted for by these factors, their understanding can guide the choice of appropriate drug and dose for an individual patient. However, final adjustments have to be made by observing the response in a given patient on a given occasion.\n\nThe factors modify drug action either:\n\n(a)Quantitatively The plasma concentration and/or the action of the drug is increased or decreased. Most of the factors introduce this type of change and can be dealt with by adjustment of drug dosage.\n\n(b)Qualitatively The type of response is altered, e.g.", "start_char_idx": 3598, "end_char_idx": 8126, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4dfd0914-8f05-4c5f-b608-0e1a0a17ec72": {"__data__": {"id_": "4dfd0914-8f05-4c5f-b608-0e1a0a17ec72", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_5.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_5.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 41467, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9ad5069a-92e2-4146-9e80-1b4f3f009534", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_5.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_5.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 41467, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "ee928072440dc7891e7e0783ee163acfba8c20630ea983fcced89a6f8bd2dc9c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "25a5c4c3-9a60-4a53-b0af-a5b79e2767a1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_5.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_5.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 41467, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "4a09cb0452ed89b4124f0039097ca2567934d9ce1482e64ed04f696cb1bfdaec", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8a09f82d-a20f-4b34-95dc-0e6eca30367c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "99caf9ded2067dc44f9de2bca19ac2acca16cdf615b69fb6371bccce77ef3769", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "atropine tachycardia depends on vagal tone, propranolol bradycardia depends on sympathetic tone, captopril hypotension depends on body Na+ status.\n\nA multitude of host and external factors influence drug response.

This is less common but often precludes further use of that drug in the affected patient.\n\nThe various factors are discussed below\u2014\n\n1. Body size It influences the concentration of the drug attained at the site of action. The average adult dose refers to individuals of medium built. For exceptionally obese or lean individuals and for children dose may be calculated on body weight (BW) basis:\n\n \n\nIt has been argued that body surface area (BSA) provides a more accurate basis for dose calculation, because total body water, extracellular fluid volume and metabolic activity are better paralleled by BSA.\n\n \n\nThe BSA of an individual can be calculated from Dubois formula:\n\n \n\nor obtained from chart-form or slide-rule nomograms based on BW and height.\n\nHowever, dose recommendations in terms of BSA are available only for anticancer and a handful of other drugs: for the rest BW has been used as the index. Thus, prescribing on BSA basis suffers from lack of data base, is more cumbersome and has not thrived, except in few cases.\n\n2. Age The dose of a drug for children is often calculated from the adult dose. Some age based formulae for calculating child dose from the adult dose have been framed, but are not in use now. Child dose is better calculated more accurately on BW basis. For many drugs, manufacturers give dosage recommendations on mg/kg basis. Average figures for children are given in the chart below.\n\nBody weight (Kg)*% ofAgeBoysGirlsAdult dose\n\n\n\nNewborn\n\n3.5\n\n3.4\n\n12.5\n\n1 month\n\n4.8\n\n4.5\n\n15\n\n3 months\n\n6.4\n\n5.8\n\n18\n\n6 months\n\n8.1\n\n7.4\n\n22\n\n1 year\n\n10.5\n\n9.7\n\n25\n\n3 years\n\n14.3\n\n13.8\n\n33\n\n5 years\n\n18.5\n\n18.2\n\n40\n\n7 years\n\n23.1\n\n22.9\n\n50\n\n9 years\n\n28.7\n\n29.1\n\n60\n\n12 years\n\n40.7\n\n41.8\n\n75\n\nHowever, infants and children are not small adults. They have important physiological differences from adults. The newborn has low g.f.r. and tubular transport is immature. As such, the t\u00bd of drugs excreted by glomerular filtration (gentamicin) and tubular secretion (penicillin) is prolonged by 3 to 5 times. Glomerular filtration reaches adult rates by 5 month of age and tubular secretion takes about 7 months to mature. Similarly, hepatic drug metabolizing system is inadequate in newborns \u2014chloramphenicol can produce gray baby syndrome (see Ch. 53). Blood-brain barrier is more permeable\u2014drugs attain higher concentration in the CNS (easy entry of unconjugated bilirubin in brain causes kernicterus). These defects are exaggerated in the premature infant. Drug absorption may also be altered in infants because of lower gastric acidity and slower intestinal transit. Transdermal absorption however, is faster because infant skin is thin and more permeable. Rectal absorption is fast and more predictable in infants and young children. Taking advantage of this fact, diazepam solution is given rectally to control febrile seizures in children < 5 years.

Drug absorption may also be altered in infants because of lower gastric acidity and slower intestinal transit. Transdermal absorption however, is faster because infant skin is thin and more permeable. Rectal absorption is fast and more predictable in infants and young children. Taking advantage of this fact, diazepam solution is given rectally to control febrile seizures in children < 5 years. Therefore, infant doses must be learned as such and not derived from any formula.\n\nAfter the first year of life, drug metabolism is often faster than in adults. Accordingly, the t\u00bd of theophylline, phenytoin, carbamazepine is shorter in children than in adults. Also, higher per kg dose is needed in children for drugs which are primarily excreted unchanged by kidney, e.g. daily dose of digoxin is about 8\u201312 \u00b5g/kg compared to adult dose of 3\u20135 \u00b5g/kg.\n\nSolid dosage forms and metered dose inhalers are difficult to administer to young children.\n\nChildren are growing and are susceptible to special adverse effects of drugs, e.g. suppression of growth can occur with corticosteroids; androgens may promote early fusion of epiphysis resulting in stunting of stature; tetracyclines get deposited in growing teeth and discolour/deform them. Dystonic reactions to phenothiazines are more common in children.\n\nElderly In the elderly, renal function progressively declines (intact nephron loss) so that g.f.r. is ~ 75% at 50 years and ~ 50% at 75 years age compared to young adults. Drug doses have to be reduced, e.g. daily dose of streptomycin is 0.75 g after 50 years and 0.5\u00a0g after 70 years of age compared to 1 g for young adults. There is also a reduction in the hepatic microsomal drug metabolizing activity and liver blood flow: oral bioavailability of drugs with high hepatic extraction is generally increased, but the overall effects on drug metabolism are not uniform. Due to lower renal as well as metabolic clearance, the elderly are prone to develop cumulative toxicity while receiving prolonged medication. Other affected aspects of drug handling are:\n\n\u2022slower absorption due to reduced gut motility as well as blood flow to intestines,\n\n\u2022lesser plasma protein binding due to lower plasma albumin, \n\n\u2022increased or decreased volume of distribution of lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs respectively.\n\nAged are relatively intolerant to digitalis. The responsiveness of \u03b2 adrenergic receptors to both agonists and antagonists is reduced in the elderly and sensitivity to other drugs also may be altered. Due to prostatism in elderly males, even mild anticholinergic activity of the drug can accentuate bladder voiding difficulty. Elderly are also likely to be on multiple drug therapy for hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, etc. which increases many fold the chances of drug interactions. They are more prone to develop postural instability, giddiness and mental confusion. In general, the incidence of adverse drug reactions is much higher in the elderly.\n\n3. Sex Females have smaller body size and require doses that are on the lower side of the range. Subjective effects of drugs may differ in females because of their mental makeup. Maintenance treatment of heart failure with digoxin is reported to be associated with higher mortality among women than among men. A number of antihypertensives (clonidine, methyldopa, \u03b2-blockers, diuretics) have potential to interfere with sexual function in males but not in females. Gynaecomastia is a side effect (of ketoconazole, metoclopramide, chlorpromazine, digitalis) that can occur only in men. Ketoconazole causes loss of libido in men but not in women.

Species and race There are many examples of differences in responsiveness to drugs among different species; rabbits are resistant to atropine, rats and mice are resistant to digitalis and rat is more sensitive to curare than cat. These differences are important while extrapolating results from experimental animals to man.\n\nAmong human beings some racial differences have been observed, e.g. blacks require higher and mongols require lower concentrations of atropine and ephedrine to dilate their pupil. \u03b2-blockers are less effective as antihypertensive in Afro-Caribbeans. Considering the widespread use of chloramphenicol in India and Hong Kong between 1950\u20131980, relatively few cases of aplastic anaemia have been reported compared to its incidence in the west. Similarly, quiniodochlor related cases of subacute myelooptic neuropathy (SMON) occurred in epidemic proportion in Japan, but there is no confirmed report of its occurrence in India despite extensive use.\n\n5. Genetics The dose of a drug to produce the same effect may vary by 4\u20136 fold among different individuals. All key determinants of drug response, viz. transporters, metabolizing enzymes, ion channels, receptors with their couplers and effectors are controlled genetically. Hence, a great deal of individual variability can be traced to the genetic composition of the subject. \n\nPharmacogenetics The study of genetic basis for variability in drug response is called \u2018Pharmacogenetics\u2019. It deals with genetic influences on drug action as well as on drug handling by the body. As the genomic technology has advanced and the human genome project has been undertaken, gene libraries and huge data bases (like \u2018pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics knowledge base\u2019, \u2018Human genome variation database\u2019, etc.) have been created aiming at improving precision in drug therapy.\n\nPharmacogenomics is the use of genetic information to guide the choice of drug and dose on an individual basis. \n\nA relationship is drawn between how a patient responds to a drug with his genetic makeup. The purpose is to identify individuals who are either more likely or less likely to respond to a drug, as well as those who require altered dose of certain drugs. Attempt is made to define the genetic basis of an individual\u2019s profile of drug response and to predict the best treatment option for him/her. So far, this has been applied largely to patients with known genetic abnormalities, but the goal is \u2018personalized medicine\u2019 on a wide scale. However, the basis of a large proportion of genetic variability still remains unexplained.\n\nA continuous variation with bell-shaped Gaussian frequency distribution is seen in the case of most drugs. In addition, there are some specific genetic defects which lead to discontinuous variation in drug responses, e.g.\u2014\n\n1.Atypical pseudocholinesterase results in prolonged succinylcholine apnoea.\n\n2.G-6PD deficiency is responsible for haemolysis with primaquine and other oxidizing drugs.

Simple spot tests for some, e.g. G-6 PD deficiency are currently in use.\n\n6. Route of administration Route of administration governs the speed and intensity of drug response (see Ch. 1). Parenteral administration is often resorted to for more rapid, more pronounced and more predictable drug action. A drug may have entirely different uses through different routes, e.g. magnesium sulfate given orally causes purgation, applied on sprained joints it decreases swelling, while intravenously it produces CNS depression and hypotension.\n\n7. Environmental factors and time of administration Several environmental factors affect drug responses. Exposure to insecticides, carcinogens, tobacco smoke and consumption of charcoal broiled meat are well known to induce drug metabolism. Type of diet and temporal relation between drug ingestion and meals can alter drug absorption, e.g. food interferes with absorption of ampicillin, but a fatty meal enhances absorption of griseofulvin and lumefantrine. Subjective effects of a drug may be markedly influenced by the setup in which it is taken. Hypnotics taken at night and in quiet, familiar surroundings may work more easily. Statins cause greater inhibition of cholesterol synthesis when taken in the late evening. It has been shown that corticosteroids taken as a single morning dose cause less pituitary-adrenal suppression.\n\n8. Psychological factor Efficacy of a drug can be affected by the patient\u2019s beliefs, attitudes and expectations. This is particularly applicable to centrally acting drugs, e.g. a nervous and anxious patient requires more general anaesthetic; alcohol generally impairs performance but if punishment (which induces anxiety) is introduced, it may actually improve performance by relieving anxiety.\n\nPlacebo This is an inert substance which is given in the garb of a medicine. It works by psychodynamic rather than pharmacodynamic means and often produces responses equivalent to the active drug. Some individuals are more suggestible and easily respond to a placebo: and are called \u2018placebo reactors\u2019. Placebos are used in two situations: \n\n1.As a control device in clinical trial of drugs (dummy medication).\n\n2.To treat a patient who, in the opinion of the physician, does not require an active drug. \n\nPlacebo is a Latin word meaning \u2018I shall please\u2019. A patient responds to the whole therapeutic setting; placebo-effect largely depends on the physician-patient relationship.\n\nPlacebos do induce physiological responses, e.g. they can release endorphins in brain\u2014causing analgesia. Naloxone, an opioid antagonist, blocks placebo analgesia. When an active drug is administered, it produces effects both due to its pharmacodynamic action as well as the psychodynamic effect of the act of medication. Placebo effects can thus supplement pharmacological effects of active medicines. However, placebo effects are highly variable even in the same individual, e.g. a placebo may induce sleep on the first night, but not subsequently. Thus, it has a very limited role in practical therapeutics. Substances commonly used as placebo are lactose tablets/capsules and distilled water injection.

Pathological states Not only drugs modify disease processes, several diseases can influence drug disposition and drug action:\n\nGastrointestinal (g.i.) diseases Certain g.i. diseases can alter absorption of orally administered drugs. The changes are complex and drug absorption can\u00a0 increase or decrease, e.g. in coeliac disease absorption of amoxicillin is decreased but that of cephalexin and cotrimoxazole is increased. Thus, malabsorption syndrome does not necessarily reduce absorption of all drugs. Gastric stasis occurring during migraine attack retards the absorption of ingested drugs. Achlorhydria decreases aspirin absorption by favouring its ionization. NSAIDs can aggravate peptic ulcer disease.\n\nLiver disease Liver disease (especially cirrhosis) can influence drug disposition in several ways:\n\n\u2022Bioavailability of drugs having high first pass metabolism (see Ch. 3) is increased due to loss of hepatocellular function and portocaval shunting.\n\n\u2022Serum albumin is reduced\u2014protein binding of acidic drugs (diclofenac, warfarin, etc.) is reduced and more drug is present in the free form.\n\n\u2022Metabolism and elimination of some drugs (morphine, lidocaine, propranolol) is decreased\u2014their dose should be reduced. Alternative drugs that do not depend on hepatic metabolism for elimination and/or have shorter t\u00bd should be preferred, e.g. oxazepam or lorazepam in place of diazepam; atenolol as \u03b2-blocker.\n\n\u2022Prodrugs needing hepatic metabolism for activation, e.g. bacampicillin are less effective and should be avoided.\n\nThe changes in drug metabolism due to liver disease are complex and there is no simple test (like creatinine clearance for renal disease) to estimate the extent of alteration in drug disposition. Moreover, the kinetics of different drugs is affected to different extents.\n\nNot only disposition, but action as well of certain drugs may be altered in liver disease, e.g.\n\n\u2022The sensitivity of brain to depressant action of morphine and barbiturates is markedly increased in cirrhotics\u2014normal doses can produce coma. \n\n\u2022Brisk diuresis can precipitate mental changes in patients with impending hepatic encephalopathy, because diuretics cause hypokalemic alkalosis which favours conversion of NH+\u200b4 to NH3. Ammonia enters brain easily and causes mental derangement. \n\n\u2022Oral anticoagulants can markedly prolong prothrombin time, because clotting factors are already low.\n\n\u2022Fluid retaining action of phenylbutazone\u00a0 (other NSAIDs as well), and lactic acidosis due to metformin are accentuated.\n\nHepatotoxic drugs should be avoided in liver disease.\n\nKidney disease It markedly affects the pharmacokinetics of many drugs as well as alters the effects of some drugs.\n\nClearance of drugs that are primarily excreted unchanged (aminoglycosides, digoxin, phenobarbitone) is reduced parallel to decrease in creatinine clearance (CLcr).

Hyperthyroid patients are relatively resistant to inotropic action of digoxin, but more prone to its arrhythmogenic action. The clearance of digoxin is roughly proportional to thyroid function, but this only partially accounts for the observed changes in sensitivity.\n\nOther examples of modification of drug response by pathological states are:\n\n\u2022Antipyretics lower body temperature only when it is raised (fever).\n\n\u2022Thiazides induce more marked diuresis in edematous patients.\n\n\u2022Myocardial infarction patients are more prone to adrenaline and digitalis induced cardiac arrhythmias.\n\n\u2022Myasthenic patients are very sensitive to curare.

Other drugs Drugs can modify the response to each other by pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction between them. Many ways in which drugs can interact have already been considered (see Ch. 2, 3, 4), and a comprehensive account of clinically important drug interactions is presented in Ch. 71.\n\n11. Cumulation Any drug will cumulate in the body if rate of administration is more than the rate of elimination. However, slowly eliminated drugs are particularly liable to cause cumulative toxicity, e.g. prolonged use of chloroquine causes retinal damage.\n\n\u2022Full loading dose of digoxin should not be given if patient has received it within the past week.\n\n\u2022A course of emetine should not be repeated within 6 weeks.\n\n12. Tolerance It refers to the requirement of higher dose of a drug to produce a given response. Tolerance is a widely occurring adaptive biological phenomenon. Loss of therapeutic efficacy after prolonged/intensive use of a drug (e.g. of sulfonylureas in type 2 diabetes, or of \u03b22 agonists in bronchial asthma), is generally called \u2018refractoriness\u2019. Drug tolerance may be:\n\nNatural The species/individual is inherently less sensitive to the drug, e.g. rabbits are tolerant to atropine; black races are tolerant to mydriatics. Certain individuals in any population are hyporesponders to certain drugs, e.g. some subjects can consume large quantity of alcohol without getting inebriated; or some hypertensives do not respond to \u03b2 adrenergic blockers.\n\nAcquired Acquired tolerance occurs by repeated use of a drug in an individual who was initially responsive. Body is capable of developing tolerance to most drugs, but the phenomenon is very easily recognized in the case of CNS depressants. An uninterrupted presence of the drug in the body favours development of tolerance. However, significant tolerance does not develop to atropine, digoxin, cocaine, sodium nitroprusside, etc. Tolerance need not develop equally to all actions of a drug, consequently therapeutic index of a drug may increase or decrease with prolonged use, e.g.:\n\n\u2022Tolerance develops to the sedative action of chlorpromazine but not to its antipsychotic action.\n\n\u2022Tolerance occurs to the sedative action of phenobarbitone but not as much to its antiepileptic action.\n\n\u2022Tolerance occurs to analgesic and euphoric action of morphine, but not as much to its constipating and miotic actions.\n\nCross tolerance It is the development of tolerance to pharmacologically related drugs, e.g. alcoholics are relatively tolerant to barbiturates and general anaesthetics.", "start_char_idx": 30704, "end_char_idx": 35172, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c7b9bdbd-ca09-4ca7-88d9-372c23923d78": {"__data__": {"id_": "c7b9bdbd-ca09-4ca7-88d9-372c23923d78", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_5.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_5.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 41467, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9ad5069a-92e2-4146-9e80-1b4f3f009534", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_5.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_5.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 41467, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "ee928072440dc7891e7e0783ee163acfba8c20630ea983fcced89a6f8bd2dc9c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d82d9ec8-0361-4a46-8170-4d42ff2ed5d6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_5.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_5.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 41467, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "a36aa73980a8958b9b94492786da413cf2bc17bb5a77f606b676a6f61008f779", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "30e416c3-b82d-4888-885f-01b25f2ac9c8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2cf7445ee16e7c5d18dd5a00107396ddd4bd642009e90643a94f6c8bbf93e8a3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "An uninterrupted presence of the drug in the body favours development of tolerance.

Closer the two drugs are, more complete is the cross tolerance between them, e.g.\u2014\n\nThere is partial cross tolerance between morphine and barbiturates but complete cross tolerance between morphine and pethidine.\n\nMechanisms of tolerance The mechanisms responsible for development of tolerance are incompletely understood. However, tolerance may be:\n\n(i)Pharmacokinetic/drug disposition tolerance\u2014the effective concentration of the drug at the site of action is decreased, mostly due to enhancement of drug elimination on chronic use, e.g. barbiturates and carbamazepine induce their own metabolism, while renal excretion of amphetamine is accelerated after regular intake.\n\n(ii)Pharmacodynamic/cellular tolerance\u2014drug action is lessened; cells of the target organ become less responsive, e.g. morphine, barbiturates, nitrates. This may be due to desensitization/down regulation of receptors (see p. 62), or weakening of response effectuation.\n\nTachyphylaxis (Tachy-fast, phylaxis-protection) It refers to rapid development of tolerance when doses of a drug repeated in quick succession result in marked reduction in response. This is usually seen with indirectly acting drugs, such as ephedrine, tyramine, nicotine. These drugs act by releasing catecholamines in the body, synthesis of which is unable to match the rate of release: stores get depleted. Other mechanisms like slow dissociation of the drug from its receptor, desensitization/internalization or down regulation of receptor, etc. (see p. 62) and/or compensatory homeostatic adaptation.\n\nDrug resistance It refers to tolerance of microorganisms to inhibitory action of antimicrobials, e.g. Staphylococci to penicillin. This phenomenon is described in Ch. 50).\n\nRational use of medicines\n\nIt is widely assumed that use of drugs by qualified doctors of modern medicine would be rational. However, in reality, irrationality abounds in almost every aspect of drug use. Medically inappropriate, ineffective and economically inefficient use of drugs occurs all over the world, more so in the developing countries. \n\nAs per the WHO \u2014 \u2018rational use of medicines requires that the patients receive medication appropriate to their clinical needs, in doses that meet their own individual requirements for an adequate period of time, and at the lowest cost to them and to their community\u2019.\n\nRational use of medicines addresses every step in the supply-use chain of drugs, i.e. selection, procurement, storage, prescribing, dispensing, monitoring and feedback. However, only rational prescribing and related aspects are dealt here.\n\nRational prescribing\n\nRational prescribing is not just the choice of a correct drug for a disease, or mere matching of drugs with diseases, but also the appropriateness of the whole therapeutic set up along with follow up of the outcome. The criteria to evaluate rational prescribing are:\n\n\u2022Appropriate indication: the reason to prescribe the medicine is based on sound medical considerations.\n\n\u2022Appropriate drug in efficacy, tolerability, safety, and suitability for the patient.\n\n\u2022Appropriate dose, route and duration according to specific features of the patient.\n\n\u2022Appropriate patient: no contraindications exist and the drug is acceptable to the patient; likelihood of adverse effect is minimal and less than the expected benefit.\n\n\u2022Correct dispensing with appropriate information/instruction to the patient.\n\n\u2022Adequate monitoring of patient\u2019s adherence to medication, as well as of anticipated beneficial and untoward effects of the medication.\n\nThere is no doubt that knowledge of the prescriber about drugs and disease is the most important determinant of his/her prescribing pattern, but it has been demonstrated time and again that simply improving knowledge has failed to promote rational drug use.

The important ones are:\n\nImpact of irrational prescribing\n\n\n\n\u2022Delay/inability in affording relief/cure of disease.\n\n\u2022More adverse drug effects.\n\n\u2022Prolongation of hospitalization; loss of man days.\n\n\u2022Increased morbidity and mortality.\n\n\u2022Emergence of microbial resistance.\n\n\u2022Financial loss to the patient/community.\n\n\u2022Loss of patient\u2019s confidence in the doctor.\n\n\u2022Lowering of health standards of patients/community.\n\n\u2022Perpetuation of public health problem.\n\nRational prescribing is a stepwise process of scientifically analyzing the therapeutic set up based on relevant inputs about the patient as well as the drug, and then taking appropriate decisions. It does not end with handing over the prescription to the patient, but extends to subsequent monitoring, periodic evaluations and modifications as and when needed, till the therapeutic goals are achieved. The important steps are summarized in the box.\n\n\n\nInformation/instructions to the patient\n\nRational prescribing also includes giving relevant and adequate information to the patient about the drug(s) and disease, as well as necessary instructions to be followed.\n\nEffects of the drug Which symptom is expected to disappear and when (e.g. antidepressant will take weeks to act); whether disease will be cured or not (e.g.", "start_char_idx": 37993, "end_char_idx": 42838, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9b948494-5d2c-4a34-9dab-3e28d9c977c1": {"__data__": {"id_": "9b948494-5d2c-4a34-9dab-3e28d9c977c1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_5.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_5.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 41467, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9ad5069a-92e2-4146-9e80-1b4f3f009534", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_5.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_5.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 41467, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "ee928072440dc7891e7e0783ee163acfba8c20630ea983fcced89a6f8bd2dc9c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "30e416c3-b82d-4888-885f-01b25f2ac9c8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_5.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_5.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 41467, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "03b5c9069e9302651a4920f4778bd43e4c03424d5bcd2bd9820265970480c34a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3e27751b-aec5-4f41-adbf-0e80d71628b3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1091e66e107fe94733659d2ef874ad00088c7d7c2f953b58bd0f51935f090ae8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Information/instructions to the patient\n\nRational prescribing also includes giving relevant and adequate information to the patient about the drug(s) and disease, as well as necessary instructions to be followed.\n\nEffects of the drug Which symptom is expected to disappear and when (e.g. antidepressant will take weeks to act); whether disease will be cured or not (e.g. diabetes, parkinsonism can only be ameliorated, but not cured), what happens if the drug is not taken as advised (e.g. tuberculosis will worsen and may prove fatal).\n\nSide effects There is considerable debate as to how much the patient should be told about the side effects. Detailed descriptions may have a suggestive effect or may scare the patient and dissuade him from taking the drug, while not informing tantamounts to negligence. The side effect, when it occurs, may upset the uninformed patient. Communicating the common side effects without discouraging the patient is a skill to be developed.\n\nInstructions How and when to take the drug (special dosage forms like inhalers, transdermal patches, etc. may need demonstration); how long to take the drug; when to come back to the doctor; instructions about diet and exercise if needed; what laboratory tests are needed, e.g. prothrombin time with coumarine anticoagulants, leucocyte count with anticancer drugs.\n\nPrecautions/warnings What precautions to take; what not to do, e.g. driving (with conventional antihistaminics) or drinking (with metronidazole), or standing still (after sublingual glyceryl trinitrate); risk of allergy or any serious reaction, etc.\n\nIn the end it should be ensured that the instructions have been properly understood by the patient. Rational prescribing, thus, is a comprehensive process.\n\nExpiry date of pharmaceuticals\n\nIt is a legal requirement that all pharmaceutical products must carry the date of manufacture and date of expiry on their label. The period between the two dates is called the \u2018life period\u2019 or \u2018shelf-life\u2019 of the medicine. Under specified storage conditions, the product is expected to remain stable (retain >95% potency) during this period. In India, the schedule P (Rule 96) of Drugs and Cosmetics Act (1940) specifies the life period (mostly 1\u20135 years) of medicinal products and the conditions of storage. The expiry of other medicines has to be specified by the manufacturer, but cannot exceed 5 years, unless permitted by the licencing authority on the basis of satisfactory stability proof.\n\nThe shelf-life of a medicine is determined by real time stability studies or by extrapolation from accelerated degradation studies. The expiry date does not mean that the medicine has actually been found to lose potency or become toxic after it, but simply that quality of the medicine is not assured beyond the expiry date, and the manufacturer is not liable if any harm arises from the use of the product. Infact, studies have shown that majority of solid oral dosage forms (tablets/capsules, etc.) stored under ordinary conditions in unopened containers remained stable for 1\u20135 years (some even up to 25 years) after the expiry date. Liquid formulations (oral and parenteral) are less stable. Suspensions clump by freezing. Injectable solutions may develop precipitates, become cloudy or discoloured by prolonged storage. Adrenaline injection (in ampoules) has been found to lose potency few months after the expiry date of 1 year (it gets oxidized).\n\nThere is hardly any report of toxicity of expired medicines. The degradation product of only one drug (tetracycline) has caused toxicity in man. Outdated tetracycline capsules produced renal tubular damage resembling Fanconi syndrome in the early 1960s. The capsules have now been reformulated to minimize degradation.\n\nLoss of potency beyond the \u2018life period\u2019 of the formulation depends on the drug as well as the storage conditions. High humidity and temperature accelerate degradation of many drugs. Though, majority of medicines, especially solid oral dosage forms, remain safe and active years after the stated expiry date, their use cannot be legally allowed beyond this date.\n\nEvidence-Based Medicine\n\nExtensive scientific investigation of drugs in man and introduction of numerous new drugs over the past few decades is gradually transforming the practice of medicine from \u2018experience based\u2019 wherein clinical decisions are made based on the experience (or rather impression) of the physician to \u2018evidence-based\u2019 wherein the same are guided by scientifically credible evidence from well designed clinical studies. \n\nEvidence-based medicine is the process of systematically finding, evaluating and using contemporary research findings as the basis of clinical decisions.\n\nResults of well designed multicentric interventional trials are forming the basis of constantly evolving guidelines for disease management.", "start_char_idx": 42468, "end_char_idx": 47319, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3e27751b-aec5-4f41-adbf-0e80d71628b3": {"__data__": {"id_": "3e27751b-aec5-4f41-adbf-0e80d71628b3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_5.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_5.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 41467, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9ad5069a-92e2-4146-9e80-1b4f3f009534", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_5.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_5.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 41467, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "ee928072440dc7891e7e0783ee163acfba8c20630ea983fcced89a6f8bd2dc9c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9b948494-5d2c-4a34-9dab-3e28d9c977c1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_5.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_5.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 41467, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "f22c516273512f7cf2f587c43ed8d8d9e7e31aad38de742c1f7d76c14c80774a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0c64ca87-542d-4a33-a374-5e3036804df0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "18a9d7f4d4f6a345a139810b125f150fc607ecc5d69c4512a531f7195a6cbd05", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The capsules have now been reformulated to minimize degradation.\n\nLoss of potency beyond the \u2018life period\u2019 of the formulation depends on the drug as well as the storage conditions.

Today\u2019s physician has to be skilled in the new techniques of searching and evaluating the literature on efficacy, safety and appropriateness of a particular therapeutic measure (drug). Therapeutic evaluation of a drug includes:\n\n\u2022Quantitation of benefit afforded by it.\n\n\u2022The best way (dosage, duration, patient selection, etc.) to use it.\n\n\u2022How it compares with other available drugs.\n\n\u2022Surveillance of adverse effects produced by it.\n\nClinical studies are basically of the following three types:\n\na.Clinical trials\n\nb.Cohort studies\n\nc.Case control studies.\n\nClinical trial\n\nClinical trial is a prospective ethically designed investigation in human subjects to objectively discover/verify/compare the results of two or more therapeutic measures (drugs).\n\nClinical trials are designed to answer one or more precisely framed questions about the value of treating equivalent groups of patients by two or more modalities (drugs, dosage regimens, other interventions). Depending on the objective of the study, clinical trial may be conducted in healthy volunteers or in volunteer patients. Healthy volunteers may be used to determine pharmacokinetic characteristics, tolerability, safety and for certain type of drugs (e.g. hypoglycaemic, hypnotic, diuretic) even efficacy. For majority of drugs (e.g. antiepileptic, antipsychotic, antiinflammatory, antitubercular, etc.) therapeutic efficacy can only be assessed in patients.\n\nEthical considerations All clinical trials must be conducted only after scrutiny and approval by an independent ethics committee as per the \u2018Good Clinical Practice\u2019 (GCP) guidelines. In India, the ICMR (2006) has brought out \u2018Ethical guidelines, for biomedical research on human participants\u2019. A proper written Informed consent of the patient/trial subject must be obtained. The ethics committee has to ensure that the study does not breach the ethical principles of: \n\nAutonomy: Freedom, dignity and confidentiality of the subject; the right to choose whether or not to participate in the trial or to continue with it. \n\nBeneficence: Motive to do good to the subject and/or the society at large. \n\nNon-maleficence: Not to do harm or put the participant at undue risk/disadvantage. \n\nJustice: Observance of fairness, honesty and impartiality in obtaining, analysing and communicating the data.\n\nControlled trial The inclusion of a proper comparator (control) group in clinical trials is crucial. The control group, which should be as similar to the test group as possible, receives either a placebo (if ethically permissible) or the existing standard treatment (active control). Separate test and control groups may run simultaneously (parallel group design), or all the subjects may be treated by the two options one after the other (cross over design) so that the same subjects serve as their own controls. Individual variation in response is thus avoided and sample size may be reduced. In the cross over design, some patients are treated first by drug \u2018A\u2019 followed by drug \u2018B\u2019, while in others the order is reversed. This nullifies the effect (if any) of order of treatment. However, there may still be \u2018carry over\u2019 effects. This design is applicable only to certain chronic diseases which remain stable over long periods.\n\nWhen one drug is compared to another drug or to a placebo, the dosage regimen (dose, frequency, duration) of the drug is decided in advance. The trial results are applicable only to this chosen regimen. No conclusions can be drawn about a higher or a lower dose. To determine the most appropriate dose, separate dose-ranging studies (trials) have to be performed. \n\nIt is well known that both the participants and the investigators of the trial are susceptible to conscious as well as unconscious bias in favour of or against the test drug.", "start_char_idx": 46156, "end_char_idx": 51113, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0c64ca87-542d-4a33-a374-5e3036804df0": {"__data__": {"id_": "0c64ca87-542d-4a33-a374-5e3036804df0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_5.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_5.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 41467, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9ad5069a-92e2-4146-9e80-1b4f3f009534", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_5.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_5.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 41467, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "ee928072440dc7891e7e0783ee163acfba8c20630ea983fcced89a6f8bd2dc9c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3e27751b-aec5-4f41-adbf-0e80d71628b3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_5.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_5.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 41467, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "36b9c6a2f35e0287d5c04279b1ecd46896f06a3428cdbd7e63f2bb536cbc936d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d986f076-9376-47cd-bf6e-067690012a4d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "52027afda2e9d9ba7629fe0b3ff5887d6fdeeeccf36a4def04d00bcc30c6d577", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In the cross over design, some patients are treated first by drug \u2018A\u2019 followed by drug \u2018B\u2019, while in others the order is reversed.

The two basic strategies for minimizing bias are \u2018randomization\u2019 and concealment or \u2018blinding\u2019. \n\nRandomization The subjects are allocated to either group using a preselected random number table or computer programme so that any subject has equal chance of being assigned to the test or the control group. Discretion (and likely bias) of the investigator/subject in treatment allocation is thus avoided. If considered necessary, stratified randomization according to age/sex/disease severity/other patient variable may be adopted.\n\nBlinding (masking) This refers to concealment of the nature of treatment (test or control) from the subject (single blind) or both the subject as well as the investigator (double blind). For this purpose the two medications have to appear similar in looks, number, weight, taste, etc. and are to be supplied in unlabelled packets marked for each patient. In double blind, the key/code to treatment allocation is kept by a third \u2018data management\u2019 party who is not involved in treating or recording observations. The code is broken at the completion of the trial and the results are analysed according to prespecified statistical method. However, all clinical trials need not be blinded. Those in which the nature of treatment is not concealed are called \u2018open\u2019 trials.\n\nRandomized controlled double blind trial (RCT) is the most credible method of obtaining evidence of efficacy, safety or comparative value of treatments.\n\nInclusion/exclusion criteria The characteristics of the subject/patient (age, sex, disease/symptom, severity and/or duration of illness, coexistent and past diseases, concurrent/preceeding drug therapy, etc.) who are to be recruited in the trial or excluded from it must be decided in advance. The trial results are applicable only to the population specified by these criteria.\n\nEnd point The primary and secondary (if any) end points (cure, degree of improvement, symptom relief, surrogate marker, avoidance of complication, curtailment of hospitalization, survival, quality of life, etc.) of the trial must be specified in advance. The results are analysed in relation to the specified end points.\n\nHigher efficacy may not always be the aim of a clinical trial. A trial may be designed to prove \u2018non-inferiority\u2019 (of the new drug) to the existing treatment, and possibly afford advantages in terms of tolerability, safety, convenience, cost or applicability to special patient subgroup(s).\n\nSample size: Both financial and ethical considerations demand that the number of subjects in the trial be the minimum needed for a valid result. The minimum number of subjects for obtaining a decisive conclusion (test better than control/control better than test/no difference between the two) must be calculated statistically beforehand. Because the trial is conducted on a sample of the whole patient population, there is always a chance that the sample was not representative of the population. Thus, the results cannot be absolutely conclusive.\u00a0 \n\nTwo types of errors are possible:\n\nType I (\u03b1) error: a difference is found between the two groups while none exists. Its possibility is called \u2018significance\u2019 of the result, e.g. if test drug is found to be better than control at a significance level of 0.05, it means that there is 5% chance that this is not real.\n\nType II (\u03b2) error: no difference is found while it really exists. The probability of failing to detect an actual difference is expressed by the \u2018power\u2019 of the trial. A power of 0.9 means that there is 10% chance of missing a real difference.\n\nThe sample size of the trial depends on the desired level of significance and power.", "start_char_idx": 50235, "end_char_idx": 54928, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d986f076-9376-47cd-bf6e-067690012a4d": {"__data__": {"id_": "d986f076-9376-47cd-bf6e-067690012a4d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_5.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_5.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 41467, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9ad5069a-92e2-4146-9e80-1b4f3f009534", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_5.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_5.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 41467, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "ee928072440dc7891e7e0783ee163acfba8c20630ea983fcced89a6f8bd2dc9c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0c64ca87-542d-4a33-a374-5e3036804df0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_5.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_5.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 41467, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "c392f22e0964dde4689fdcefff3184f0a4e5fb6208e7234e42a6fe684d5ea3a3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "764f2af6-1680-423c-9d86-a07543c40c8c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "37f3dba2fcbe16a8f572b482c6e7797ec9c44d09dbe6ae4b42e6d5afe719ba86", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Because the trial is conducted on a sample of the whole patient population, there is always a chance that the sample was not representative of the population.

A power of 0.9 means that there is 10% chance of missing a real difference.\n\nThe sample size of the trial depends on the desired level of significance and power. The other input needed for calculation of sample size is the magnitude of difference between the two groups that is expected or is considered clinically significant, e.g. a 10% reduction in pain intensity may not be considered clinically significant, while a 10% reduction in mortality may be worthwhile. Larger sample size is required to detect smaller difference. Also, higher the significance and power level desired, greater is the number of subjects. The variability of response in terms of the primary end point also affects the sample size. Responses that show greater individual variation need larger number of subjects to achieve the desired significance and power levels.\n\nMany large scale trials are subjected to interim analysis from time to time as the trial progresses by an independent committee which can order an early termination if a decisive result (positive or negative) is obtained; because it would be unethical to subject some of the remaining patients to a treatment (test or control) which has been found inferior.\n\nMulticentric trial Many large trials are conducted at more than one centre by as many teams of investigators, sometimes spread over several countries. The advantages are:\n\n\u2022Larger number of patients can be recruited in a shorter period of time.\n\n\u2022Results are applicable to a wider population base which may cover several countries/ethnic groups.\n\n\u2022Regulatory requirements of several countries may be satisfied.\n\n\u2022Credibility of the trial is enhanced.\n\nThe phase III trials are generally multicentric. \n\nSequential trial\n\nThis design attempts to detect a significant result as soon as it is achieved, minimizing the number of subjects. The trial is conducted on matched pairs of subjects and is scored as \u2018A\u2019 treatment better than \u2018B\u2019 or \u2018B\u2019 better than \u2018A\u2019 or no difference. This is plotted continuously as the trial proceeds till the boundries of predetermined level of significant superiority/inferiority/no difference are touched. The trial is then terminated. This design is applicable only to certain types of drugs and diseases for which clinical end points are achieved quickly and paired comparisons are possible. Moreover, it may not always be practicable to recruit matching pairs of trial subjects.\n\nMeta-analysis \n\nThis is an exercise in which data from several similarly conducted randomized controlled clinical trials with the same drug (or class of drugs) examining the same clinical end point(s) is pooled to bring out the overall balance of evidence by enlarging the number of test and control subjects and increasing the significance and power of the conclusions. Because individual trials are often conducted on relatively smaller number of patients, some may fail to detect a significant difference, while others may find it. Discordant results are published which confuse the medical practitioner. There are many criticisms of meta-analysis, such as:\n\na.bias in the selection of trials for analysis (selection bias);\n\nb.unintentional exclusion of negative results which are less likely to be published (publication bias);\n\nc.nonuniformity of the trials in details of methodology and conduct.\n\nNevertheless, meta-analysis is a useful tool to arrive at conclusions that may influence medical practice. For example, meta-analysis of trials has strongly supported the use of \u03b2-adrenergic blockers in heart failure and use of statins to reduce risk of coronary artery disease.\n\nTo be reliable, the meta-analysis should observe the following:\n\n\u2022Comprehensive search of the literature to identify all eligible trials.\n\n\u2022Use objective criteria in selecting the trials for inclusion.\n\n\u2022Include only randomized trials of assured quality.\n\n\u2022Employ proper statistical methods in pooling and treating the data from individual trials.\n\nMeta-analysis are now frequently published on contemporary therapeutic issues.\n\nCohort study\n\nThis is a type of observational study in which no intervention for the sake of the study is done. \u2018Cohort\u2019 is a group of individuals having some common features.

In the context of drug research, the common feature is that all study subjects have taken a particular drug. Occurrence of events (beneficial or adverse) in users and nonusers of the drug is compared. Prescription event monitoring is a cohort study. The cohort study can be a prospective or a retrospective study. In the prospective design, all patients who receive the study drug are followed up for therapeutic outcomes or adverse effects. A matching group of patients who have not received the drug is identified and followed up to serve as control. Cohort studies are primarily used to discover uncommon adverse effects that may be missed during formal therapeutic trials which involve fewer patients and often exclude certain type of patients who may be susceptible to that adverse effect. Its value for defining therapeutic outcomes is less credible. The limitations of cohort studies are that controls included may not be appropriate, and relatively long period of follow up is needed.\n\nGrades of strength of evidence\n\n\n\nGrade I\n\nSystematic reviews/Meta-analysis\n\nMost reliable, may form the basis of clinical decisions\n\nGrade II\n\nWell powered randomized controlled trial/more than one trials\n\nReliable, but may be supported or refuted by similar studies\n\nGrade III\n\nOpen label trials/pilot studies/observational (cohort and case-control) studies (prospective or retrospective)\n\nLess reliable, need more rigorous testing, may indicate further investigation\n\nGrade IV\n\nCase reports/anecdotal reports/clinical experience\n\nLeast reliable; may serve as pointers to initiate formal studies\n\nIn the retrospective cohort study, health records of a population are scrutinized for exposure to the study drug and the subsequent beneficial/adverse events. Its value is questionable because many events may have been missed in the records and several unknown factors may have contributed to the findings. However, it may serve as pointer, or to arouse suspicion.\n\nCase control study\n\nThis type of observational study is used mainly to reveal association of a suspected rare adverse event with the use of a particular drug. Cases of the suspected adverse event (e.g. agranulocytosis) are collected from hospital records or disease registries, etc. A matched control group similar in other respects but not having the adverse event is selected. Drug histories of both groups are traced backwards to compare exposure to the indicated drug (e.g. phenylbutazone) among patients with the adverse event to those without it. The suspicion is strengthened if high association is found. Though case control studies can be performed rather quickly because the number of patients analysed is small compared to the cohort design, they do not prove causality. Moreover, the causative drug and the adverse event have to be suspected first to plan the study, whereas cohort study can reveal unsuspected adverse events. Variable accuracy of retrospective records, non-randomly selected control group, chances of bias and a variety of unknown factors make the case control study a weak instrument for affording convincing evidence.\n\nGrading strength of evidence \n\nThe strength of evidence from the conclusions of various kinds of trials, studies and reports has been graded from strong to weak as presented in the box. \n\nNew drug development\n\nIn this era of bewildering new drug introduction and rapid attrition of older drugs, the doctor needs to have an overall idea of the manner in which new drugs are developed and marketed. Drug development now is a highly complex, tedious, competitive, costly and commercially risky process. From the synthesis/identification of the molecule to marketing, a new drug takes at least 10 years and costs 500\u20131000 million US$. As such, invention and development of new drugs is now possible only in the set up of big pharmaceutical houses that alone have the resources, infrastructure and dedicated teams of scientists to carry out the multiple specialized stages of the process. Though the pharmaceutical industry is often regarded cunning, greedy, unscrupulous, deceptive and fleecing the people, there is no denying that it is responsible for most of the progress in therapeutics as well as pharmacological knowledge of today.\u00a0 \n\nStages in new drug development", "start_char_idx": 58085, "end_char_idx": 63247, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b18f768b-7395-4acc-827d-ca30eabd1dcc": {"__data__": {"id_": "b18f768b-7395-4acc-827d-ca30eabd1dcc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_5.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_5.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 41467, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9ad5069a-92e2-4146-9e80-1b4f3f009534", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_5.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_5.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 41467, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "ee928072440dc7891e7e0783ee163acfba8c20630ea983fcced89a6f8bd2dc9c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "764f2af6-1680-423c-9d86-a07543c40c8c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_5.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_5.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 41467, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "283f27497e2a6ab1009d13387b3fa4de9a0a92767471e8482b8ccc878c3bafe2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "baac0c06-ac07-4b07-a470-7e3bb6fdc71d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dfaefb205da2c2d023a7a422b6021dd4214100865b12d9e162393269996211c5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Synthesis/isolation of the compound:\n\n(1\u20132 years)\n\nPreclinical studies: screening, evaluation, pharmacokinetic and short-term toxicity testing in animals: \n\n(2\u20134 years)\n\nScrutiny and grant of permission for clinical trials:\n\n(3\u20136 months)\n\nPharmaceutical formulation, standardization of chemical/biological/immuno-assay of the compound: \n\n(0.5\u20131 year)\n\nClinical studies: phase I, phase II, phase III trials; long-term animal toxicity testing: \n\n(3\u201310 years)\n\nReview and grant of marketing permission:\n\n(0.5\u20132 years)\n\nPostmarketing surveillance: \n\n(phase IV studies)\n\nThe major steps/stages in the development of a new drug are given in the box.\n\nApproaches to drug discovery/invention\n\nExploration of natural sources Plants are the oldest source of medicines. Clues about these have been obtained from traditional systems of medicine prevalent in various parts of the world; Opium (morphine), Ephedra (ephedrine), Cinchona (quinine), curare (tubocurarine), belladonna (atropine), Quinghaosu (artemisinin) are the outstanding examples. Though animal parts have been used as cures since early times, it was physiological experiments performed in the 19th and early 20th century that led to introduction of some animal products into medicine, e.g. adrenaline, thyroxine, insulin, liver extract, antisera, etc. Few minerals (iron/calcium salts, etc.) are the other natural medicinal substances. The discovery of penicillin (1941) opened the flood-gates of a vast source\u2014microorganisms\u2014of a new kind of drugs (antibiotics). The use of microbes for production of vaccines is older than their use to produce antibiotics.\n\nThough few drugs are now produced from plants, animals or microbes, these sources of medicines are by no means exhausted. However, they mostly serve as lead compounds.\n\nRandom or targeted chemical synthesis Synthetic chemistry made its debut in the 19th century and is now the largest source of medicines. Randomly synthesized compounds can be tested for a variety of pharmacological activities. Though some useful drugs (barbiturates, chlorpromazine) have been produced serendipitously by this approach, it has very low probability of hitting at the right activity in the right compound; rarely employed now.\n\nLead optimization A more practical approach is to synthesize chemical congeners of natural products/synthetic compounds with known pharmacological activity in the hope of producing more selective/superior drugs. Many families of clinically useful drugs have been fathered by a \u2018lead compound\u2019. Often only \u2018me too\u2019 drugs are produced, but sometimes breakthroughs are achieved, e.g. thiazide diuretics from acetazolamide, tricyclic antidepressants from phenothiazines.\n\nStudy of several congeners of the lead compound can delineate molecular features responsible for a particular property. Application of this structure-activity relationship information has proven useful on many occasions, e.g. selective \u03b22 agonists (salbutamol) and \u03b2 blockers (propranolol, etc.) have been produced by modifying the structure of isoprenaline, H2 blockers by modifying the side chain of histamine, ethinyl-estradiol by introducing a substitution that resists metabolic degradation, mesoprostol (more stable) by esterifying PGE1.\n\nMore commonly now, as described later in the rational approach, identification of the target biomolecule is the starting point for new drug invention. A lead compound capable of interacting with the target is searched by applying diverse approaches described above and below. The affinity and selectivity of the lead compound for the target is determined. It is then chemically modified to optimise these parameters as well as pharmacokinetic, pharmaceutical, toxicological and other characteristics.

Truly new classes of drugs generally follow the identification of a novel target for drug action, such as H+K+ATPase for gastric acid suppression or glycoprotein IIa/IIIb receptor for platelet function inhibition.The drug is aimed at mitigating the derangement caused by the disease, e.g. levodopa was tried in parkinsonism based on the finding that the condition resulted from deficiency of dopamine in the striatum. The purine, pyrimidine, folate antimetabolites were introduced in cancer chemotherapy after elucidation of key role of these metabolites in cell proliferation. Because virus directed reverse transcriptase is unique to retroviruses, its inhibitors have been developed as anti-HIV drugs. This approach is very attractive but requires a lot of basic research.\n\nMolecular modelling Advances in protein chemistry and computer aided elucidation of three-dimensional structure of key receptors, enzymes, etc. has permitted designing of targeted compounds. Suitable computer programmes are being used to optimise the three-dimensional structure of the candidate drug to fit the identified target site(s) and/or have optimum pharmacokinetics. The designing of selective COX-2 inhibitors was prompted by the comparative configuration of COX-1 and COX-2 isoenzyme molecules. Study of drug binding to mutated receptors and elucidation of configuration of drug-receptor complexes is now guiding production of improved drugs. Attempts are being made to produce individualized drugs according to pharmacogenomic suitability.\n\nCombinatorial chemistry Chemical groups are combined in a random manner to yield innumerable compounds and subjected to high-throughput screening on cells, genetically engineered microbes, receptors, enzymes, etc. in robotically controlled automated assay systems.

Other experimental approaches in new drug development are antisense oligonucleotides and gene therapy.\n\nPreclinical studies\n\nAfter synthesizing/identifying a prospective compound, it is tested on animals to expose the whole pharmacological profile. Experiments are generally performed on a rodent (mouse, rat, guinea pig, hamster, rabbit) and then on a larger animal (cat, dog, monkey). As the evaluation progresses unfavourable compounds get rejected at each step, so that only a few out of thousands reach the stage when administration to man is considered.\n\nThe following types of tests are performed.\n\n1.Screening tests These are simple and rapidly performed tests to indicate presence or absence of a particular pharmacodynamic activity that is sought for, e.g. analgesic or hypoglycaemic activity.\n\n2.Tests on isolated organs, bacterial cultures, etc. These also are preliminary tests to detect specific activity, such as antihistaminic, antisecretory, vasodilator, antibacterial, etc.\n\n3.Tests on animal models of human disease Such as kindled seizures in rats, spontaneously (genetically) hypertensive rats, experimental tuberculosis in mouse, alloxan induced diabetes in rat or dog, etc.\n\n4.Confirmatory tests and analogous activities Compounds found active are taken up for detailed study by more elaborate tests which confirm and characterize the activity. Other related activities, e.g. antipyretic and anti-inflammatory activity in an analgesic are tested.\n\n5.Systemic pharmacology Irrespective of the primary action of the drug, its effects on major organ systems such as nervous, cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, g.i.t are worked out. Mechanism of action, including additional mechanisms, e.g. \u03b1 adrenergic blockade, calcium channel blockade, nitro-vasodilatation, etc. in a \u03b2 adrenergic blocker antihypertensive, are elucidated. \n\n6.Quantitative tests The dose-response relationship, maximal effect and comparative potency/efficacy with existing drugs is ascertained.\n\n7.Pharmacokinetics\u00a0 The absorption, volume of distribution, metabolism, excretion, pattern of tissue distribution and plasma half-life of the drug are quantified.\n\n8.Toxicity tests The aim is to determine safety of the compound in at least 2 animal species, one rodent and one nonrodent, e.g. mouse/rat and dog by oral and parenteral routes.\n\nAcute toxicity: Single escalating doses are given to small groups of animals that are observed for overt effects and mortality for 1\u20133 days. The dose which kills 50% animals (LD50) is calculated. Organ toxicity is examined by histopathology on all animals.\n\nSubacute toxicity: Repeated doses are given for 2\u201312 weeks depending on the duration of intended treatment in man. Doses are selected on the basis of ED50 and LD50. Animals are examined for overt effects, food intake, body weight, haematology, etc. and organ toxicity.\n\nChronic toxicity: The drug is given for 6\u201312 months and effects are studied as in subacute toxicity. This is generally undertaken concurrently with early clinical trials.\n\nReproduction and teratogenicity: Effects on spermatogenesis, ovulation, fertility and developing foetus are studied.\n\nMutagenicity: Ability of the drug to induce genetic damage is assessed in bacteria (Ames test), mammalian cell cultures and in intact rodents.\n\nCarcinogenicity: Drug is given for long-term, even the whole life of the animal and they are watched for development of tumours.\n\nStandardised procedures under \u2018Good Laboratory Practices\u2019 (GLP) have been laid down for the conduct of animal experiments, especially toxicity testing.\n\nClinical trials\n\nWhen a compound deserving trial in man is identified by animal studies, the regulatory authorities are approached who on satisfaction issue an \u2018investigational new drug\u2019 (IND) licence.", "start_char_idx": 70311, "end_char_idx": 75020, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7045040f-c4a5-4cbb-9ad9-11dfacfc73f2": {"__data__": {"id_": "7045040f-c4a5-4cbb-9ad9-11dfacfc73f2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_5.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_5.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 41467, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9ad5069a-92e2-4146-9e80-1b4f3f009534", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_5.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_5.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 41467, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "ee928072440dc7891e7e0783ee163acfba8c20630ea983fcced89a6f8bd2dc9c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f6d5bbf8-3719-412b-92b4-64b4afb4f24a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_5.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_5.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 41467, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "704fc8ead19f706364080abb4141aa8fe1cb31aa2897c4547263d288d6654ec5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "34374733-9486-4989-b977-07a7cef703e7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "722ca02e78f496468b93ad23ed629359650b780bb717beb836a3ea56d88b6ea3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "and organ toxicity.\n\nChronic toxicity: The drug is given for 6\u201312 months and effects are studied as in subacute toxicity.

The drug is formulated into a suitable dosage form and clinical trials are conducted in a logical phased manner. To minimize any risk, initially few subjects receive the drug under close supervision. Later, larger numbers are treated with only relevant monitoring.\u00a0 Standards for the design, ethics, conduct, monitoring, auditing, recording and analyzing data and reporting of clinical trials have been laid down in the form of \u2018Good Clinical Practice\u2019 (GCP) guidelines by an International Conference on Harmonization (ICH). National agencies in most countries, including ICMR in India, have also framed ethical guidelines for clinical trials. Adherence to these provides assurance that the data and reported results are credible and accurate, and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial subjects are protected as enunciated in the Helsinki Declaration of the World Medical Association. The requirements and regulations for the conduct of clinical trials on a new drug in India have been laid down in the schedule Y of the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules. \n\nThe clinical studies are conventionally divided into 4 phases.\n\nPhase I: Human pharmacology and safety\n\nThe first human administration of the drug is carried out by qualified clinical pharmacologists/trained physicians in a setting where all vital functions are monitored and emergency/resuscitative facilities are available. Subjects (mostly healthy volunteers, sometimes patients) are exposed to the drug one by one (total 20\u201380 subjects), starting with the lowest estimated dose (generally 1/100 to 1/10 of the highest dose producing no toxicity in animals) and increasing stepwise to achieve the effective dose. An attempt is made to determine the dose range that may be used in further studies. The emphasis is on safety, tolerability, and to detect any potentially dangerous effects on vital functions, such as precipitous fall/rise in blood pressure or heart rate, arrhythmias, bronchospasm, seizures, kidney/liver damage, etc. Unpleasant side effects are noted and an attempt is made to observe the pharmacodynamic effects in man. The human pharmacokinetic parameters of the drug are measured for the first time. No blinding is done: the study is open label.\n\nPhase 0: Microdosing study\n\nThis is a new strategy being developed to reduce the cost and time of the drug development process. The rate of rejection of candidate drugs at various stages of clinical development has progressively increased recently, discouraging pharmaceutical companies to venture into the risky business of new drug invention. This has alarmed the FDA (USA) and the European Medicines Agency to encourage novel cost-cutting approaches in drug development. One such tool is the microdosing human study undertaken before phase-1 trial, and is also called phase \u20180\u2019 study. \n\nMany candidate drugs fail during clinical trials due to sub-optimal human pharmacokinetics. Very low doses, generally about 1/100th of the estimated human dose, or a maximum of 100 \u00b5g total dose of candidate drug, are administered to healthy volunteers and pharmacokinetics is worked out using highly sophisticated instrumentation, such as Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) with radiolabelled drug, or LC-Tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) to measure ultra low drug levels. These subpharmacological doses are not expected to produce any therapeutic or toxic effects, but yield human pharmacokinetic information. These studies may obviate the need for animal pharmacokinetic studies and can be undertaken before extensive animal toxicity tests. Thus, elaborate animal studies and costly phase 1 human trials could be avoided for candidate drugs which would have later failed due to unsuitable human pharmacokinetics. Moreover, the pharmacokinetic 0 phase data could be useful in more precise selection of doses for phase 1 study.", "start_char_idx": 74081, "end_char_idx": 78878, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "34374733-9486-4989-b977-07a7cef703e7": {"__data__": {"id_": "34374733-9486-4989-b977-07a7cef703e7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_5.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_5.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 41467, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9ad5069a-92e2-4146-9e80-1b4f3f009534", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_5.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_5.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 41467, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "ee928072440dc7891e7e0783ee163acfba8c20630ea983fcced89a6f8bd2dc9c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7045040f-c4a5-4cbb-9ad9-11dfacfc73f2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "Chapter_5.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/Chapter_5.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 41467, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "30c0aeab937b9d360f80eecc5ee51e700a863c4b34fc520ff72117c2aa8b752e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fe331a80-ee6f-4a12-938d-7b9c3d7aac03", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cf14957af335ceb7f5d464300e68813a17b7f99a56f8d7796b418e9b0a54853c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Very low doses, generally about 1/100th of the estimated human dose, or a maximum of 100 \u00b5g total dose of candidate drug, are administered to healthy volunteers and pharmacokinetics is worked out using highly sophisticated instrumentation, such as Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) with radiolabelled drug, or LC-Tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) to measure ultra low drug levels.

Moreover, the pharmacokinetic 0 phase data could be useful in more precise selection of doses for phase 1 study. \n\nThe major objection against phase \u20180\u2019 study is that the microdose pharmacokinetics may be quite different from that at pharmacological doses, since body may handle such divergent doses in different ways. The phase 0 studies have not yet been technically fully developed or adequately evaluated. They are neither established nor mandatory. However, they are promising, and most regulatory authorities are willing to allow and consider them. \n\nPhase II: Therapeutic exploration and dose ranging\n\nThis is conducted by physicians who are trained as clinical investigators, and involve 100\u2013500 patients selected according to specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. The primary aim is establishment of therapeutic efficacy, dose range and ceiling effect in a controlled setting. Tolerability and pharmacokinetics are studied as extension of phase I. The study is mostly controlled and randomized, and may be blinded or open label. It is generally carried out at 2\u20134 centres. The candidate drug may get dropped at this stage if the desired level of clinical efficacy is not obtained.\n\nPhase III: Therapeutic confirmation/comparison\n\nGenerally these are randomized double blind comparative trials conducted on a larger patient population (500\u20133000) by several physicians (usually specialists in treating the target disease) at many centres. The aim is to establish the value of the drug in relation to existing therapy. Safety and tolerability are assessed on a wider scale, while pharmacokinetic studies may be conducted on some of the participants to enlarge the population base of pharmacokinetic data. Indications are finalized and guidelines for therapeutic use are formulated. A \u2018new drug application\u2019 (NDA) is submitted to the licencing authority (like FDA), who if convinced give marketing permission. Restricted marketing permission for use only in hospitals with specific monitoring facilities, or only by specially trained physicians may be granted in case of toxic drugs which are found useful in serious or otherwise incurable diseases. \n\nPhase IV: Postmarketing surveillance/data gathering studies\n\nAfter the drug has been marketed for general use, practicing physicians are identified through whom data are collected on a structured proforma about the efficacy, acceptability and adverse effects of the drug in the real field situation (similar to prescription event monitoring). Patients treated in the normal course form the study population: numbers therefore are much larger.

In a broad sense, it deals with interaction of exogenously administered chemical molecules with living systems, and any single chemical substance which can produce a biological response is a \u2018drug\u2019. Pharmacology encompasses all aspects of knowledge about drugs, but most importantly those that are relevant to effective and safe use of drugs for medicinal purposes. \n\nFor thousands of years most drugs were crude natural products of unknown composition and limited efficacy. Only the overt effects of these substances on the body were rather imprecisely known, but how the same were produced was entirely unknown. Animal experiments, primarily aimed at understanding physiological processes, were started in the 18th century. These were pioneered by F. Magendie and Claude Bernard, who also adapted them to study effects of certain drugs. Pharmacology as an experimental science was ushered by Rudolf Buchheim who founded the first institute of pharmacology in 1847 in Germany. In the later part of the 19th century, Oswald Schmiedeberg, regarded as the \u2018father of pharmacology\u2019, together with his many disciples like J Langley, T Frazer, P Ehrlich, AJ Clark, JJ Abel propounded some of the fundamental concepts in pharmacology. Since then drugs have been purified, chemically characterized and a vast variety of highly potent and selective new drugs have been developed. The mechanism of action including molecular target of many drugs has been elucidated. This has been possible due to prolific growth of pharmacology which forms the backbone of rational therapeutics. \n\nThe two main divisions of pharmacology are pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics.\n\nPharmacodynamics (Greek: dynamis\u2014power) \u2014What the drug does to the body.\n\nThis includes physiological and biochemical effects of drugs and their mechanism of action at organ system/subcellular/macromolecular levels, e.g.\u2014Adrenaline \u2192 interaction with adrenoceptors \u2192 G-protein mediated stimulation of cell membrane bound adenylyl cyclase \u2192 increased intracellular cyclic 3\u00b4,5\u00b4AMP \u2192 cardiac stimulation, hepatic glycogenolysis and hyperglycaemia, etc.\n\nPharmacokinetics (Greek: Kinesis\u2014movement)\u2014What the body does to the drug.\n\nThis refers to movement of the drug in and alteration of the drug by the body; includes absorption, distribution, binding/localization/storage, biotransformation and excretion of the drug, e.g. paracetamol is rapidly and almost completely absorbed orally attaining peak blood levels at 30\u201360 min; 25% bound to plasma proteins, widely and almost uniformly distributed in the body (volume of distribution ~ 1L/kg); extensively metabolized in the liver, primarily by glucuronide and sulfate conjugation into inactive metabolites which are excreted in urine; has a plasma half life (t\u00bd) of 2\u20133 hours and a clearance value of 5 ml/kg/min.\n\nDrug (French: Drogue\u2014a dry herb) It is the single active chemical entity present in a medicine that is used for diagnosis, prevention, treatment/cure of a disease. \n\nThis disease oriented definition of drug does not include contraceptives or use of drugs for improvement of health. The WHO (1966) has given a more comprehensive definition\u2014\u201cDrug is any substance or product that is used or is intended to be used to modify or explore physiological systems or pathological states for the benefit of the recipient.\u201d\n\nThe term \u2018drugs\u2019 is being also used to mean addictive/abused/illicit substances. However, this restricted and derogatory sense usage is unfortunate degradation of a time honoured term, and \u2018drug\u2019 should refer to a substance that has some health promoting/therapeutic/diagnostic application. Nevertheless, to avoid any misinterpretation, the term \u2018medicine\u2019 is being employed to designate such a substance in place of the term \u2018drug\u2019.\n\nSome other important aspects of pharmacology are:\n\nPharmacotherapeutics It is the application of pharmacological information together with knowledge of the disease for its prevention, mitigation or cure. Selection of the most appropriate drug, dosage and duration of treatment taking into account the stage of disease and the specific features of a patient are a part of pharmacotherapeutics.\n\nClinical pharmacology It is the scientific study of drugs (both old and new) in man. It includes pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic investigation in healthy volunteers as well as in patients. Evaluation of efficacy and safety of drugs and comparative trials with other forms of treatment; surveillance of patterns of drug use, adverse effects, etc. are also part of clinical pharmacology.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4703, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "13e5df5c-9785-4cf2-b5bf-f4258d948c20": {"__data__": {"id_": "13e5df5c-9785-4cf2-b5bf-f4258d948c20", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "chapter_1.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/chapter_1.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 24636, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "39b7f7f7-90a5-498a-8ef5-189c50d3cc52", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "chapter_1.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/chapter_1.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 24636, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "3d30339e395da8894d69360f3f14a03c15dc3d209a0f1b2a2552ca03554b9b04", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fe331a80-ee6f-4a12-938d-7b9c3d7aac03", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "chapter_1.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/chapter_1.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 24636, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "0698b1e7d1687f9106e1aa933adc1a2ea1781e8c694e6e9aa9b6d2df461f371c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "06201344-aba8-4202-8131-fc29dc65ebac", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8e85514c420bee76277139f6c5b97bb52c793555688348a38150afe0dffa449b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Nevertheless, to avoid any misinterpretation, the term \u2018medicine\u2019 is being employed to designate such a substance in place of the term \u2018drug\u2019.\n\nSome other important aspects of pharmacology are:\n\nPharmacotherapeutics It is the application of pharmacological information together with knowledge of the disease for its prevention, mitigation or cure.

It includes collection, identification, purification, isolation, synthesis, standardization and quality control of medicinal substances. The large scale manufacture of drugs is called Pharmaceutics, which is primarily a technological science.\n\nToxicology It is the study of poisonous effect of drugs and other chemicals (household, environmental pollutant, industrial, agricultural, homicidal) with emphasis on detection, prevention and treatment of poisonings. It also includes the study of adverse effects of drugs, since the same substance can be a drug or a poison, depending on the dose.\n\nnature of drugs\n\nAll drugs are chemical entities with simple or complex molecules. While majority are organic compounds, some are purely inorganic, like lithium carbonate, ferrous sulfate, magnesium hydroxide, etc. Organic drugs may be weakly acidic (aspirin, penicillin) or weakly basic (morphine, chloroquine) or nonelectrolytes (alcohol, diethyl-ether). Most drugs are normally solids, e.g. paracetamol, propranolol, furosemide, ampicillin, etc., but some such as ethanol, glyceryl trinitrate, propofol, castor oil are liquids, and few like nitrous oxide are gaseous.\n\nThe molecular weight of majority of drugs falls in the range of 100-1000 D, because molecules smaller than 100 D do not generally have sufficiently specific features in terms of shape, size, configuration, chirality, distribution of charges, etc. to selectively bind to only one/few closely related target biomolecules, to the exclusion of others. On the other hand, larger molecules than 1000 D do not readily pass through membranes/barriers in the body to reach the target sites in various tissues/cells. However, few drugs are as small as lithium ion (7D), and some like heparin (10-20 KD), gonadotropins (>30 KD), enzymes, proteins, antibodies (>50 KD) are much bigger. Bulky molecule drugs have to be administered parenterally.\n\nDrugs are generally perceived to be chemical substances foreign to the body (Xenobiotics). However, many endogenous chemicals like hormones, autacoids, metabolites and nutrients are also used as drugs. Chemical congeners of these metabolites/signal molecules are an important class of drugs which act by modifying the synthesis, storage, degradation or action of these metabolites/signal molecules.\n\nsources of drugs\n\nDrugs are obtained from a variety of sources:\n\n1.Plants Many plants contain biologically active substances and are the oldest source of drugs. Clues about medicinal plants were obtained from traditional systems of medicine prevalent in various parts of the world; e.g. use of opium, belladonna, ephedra, cinchona, curare, foxglove, sarpagandha, qinghaosu has been learnt from Egyptian, Greek, Aztec, Ayurvedic, chinese and other systems of medicine.

Chemically the active ingredients of plants fall in several categories:\n\na.Alkaloids: These are alkaline nitrogenous bases having potent activity, and are the most important category of vegetable origin drugs. Prominent examples are: morphine, atropine, ephedrine, nicotine, ergotamine, reserpine, quinine, vincristine, etc. They are mostly used as their water soluble hydrochloride/ sulfate salts.\n\nb.Glycosides: These compounds consist of a heterocyclic nonsugar moiety (aglycone) linked to a sugar moiety through ether linkage. Cardiac glycosides (digoxin, ouabain) are the best known glycosidic drugs. The active principle of senna and similar plant purgatives are anthraquinone glycosides. Aminoglycosides (gentamicin, etc.) are antibiotics obtained from microorganisms, and have an aminosugar in place of a sugar moiety.\n\nc.Oils: These are viscous, inflammable liquids, insoluble in water. Fixed (nonvolatile) oils are calorie yielding triglycerides of higher fatty acids; mostly used for food and as emollients, e.g. groundnut oil, coconut oil, sesame oil, etc. Castor oil is a stimulant purgative. Essential (volatile) oils, mostly obtained from flowers or leaves by steam distillation are aromatic (fragrant) terpene hydrocarbons that have no food value. They are used as flavouring agents, carminatives, counterirritants and astringents; examples are eucalyptus oil, pepermint oil, nilgiri oil, etc. Clove oil is used to allay dental pain. Menthol, thymol, camphor are volatile oils that are solids at room temperature. \n\nMineral oils are not plant products, but obtained from petroleum; liquid paraffin is a lubricant laxative, soft and hard paraffin are used as emollient and as ointment bases.\n\nOther plant products like tanins are astringent; gums are demulcents and act as suspending agents in liquid dosage forms. Glycerine is a viscous, sweet liquid used as vehicle for gum/throat paint. Resins and balsams are used as antiseptic and in cough mixtures. The antimalarial drug artemisinin is a sesquiterpene endoperoxide obtained from a Chinese plant.\n\n2.Animals Though animal parts have been used as cures since early times, it was exploration of activity of organ extracts in the late 19th and early 20th century that led to introduction of animal products into medicine, e.g. adrenaline, thyroxine, insulin, liver extract (vit. B12). Antisera and few vaccines are also produced from animals.\n\n3.Microbes Most antibiotics are obtained from fungi, actinomycetes and bacteria, e.g. penicillin, gentamicin, tetracycline, erythromycin, polymyxin B, actinomycin D (anticancer). Some enzymes, e.g. diastase from a fungus and streptokinase from streptococci have a microbial source. Vaccines are produced by the use of microbes.\n\n4.Minerals Few minerals, e.g. iron salts, calcium salts, lithium carbonate, magnesium/aluminium hydroxide, iodine are used as medicinal substances.\n\n5.Synthetic chemistry Synthetic chemistry made its debut in the 19th century, and is now the largest source of medicines.

Synthetic drugs have the advantage of purity and uniformity of the product. They can be manufactured in any quantity as per need, in contrast to drugs from natural sources whose availability may be limited. Not only diverse congeners of naturally obtained drugs (atropine substitutes, adrenergic b2 agonists, synthetic glucocorticoids/progestins/cephalosporins, etc.) have been introduced to achieve greater selectivity of action or even novel type of activity, but many entirely synthetic families of drugs, e.g. benzodiazepines, thiazides, benzimidazoles, fluoroquinolones, etc. have been produced. Many drugs are being synthesized to target specific biomolecules, e.g. ACE inhibitors, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists, HIV-reverse transcriptase inhibitors, etc. Synthetic drugs that are chiral can also be produced as single active enantiomer products, which may be therapeutically superior.\n\n6.Biotechnology Several drugs, especially peptides and proteins are now produced by recombinant DNA technology, e.g. human growth hormone, human insulin, altaplase, interferon, etc. Monoclonal antibodies, regulator peptides, erythropoietin and other growth factors are the newer drugs of biotechnological origin. protein therapeutics is rapidly expanding, because specifically designed and customized proteins can now be produced.\n\nDrug nomenclature\n\nA drug generally has three categories of names:\n\n(a)Chemical name It describes the substance chemically, e.g. 1-(Isopropylamino)-3-(1-naphthyloxy) propan-2-ol for propranolol. This is cumbersome and not suitable for use in prescribing. A code name, e.g. RO 15-1788 (later named flumazenil) may be assigned by the manufacturer for convenience and simplicity before an approved name is coined.\n\n(b)Non-proprietary name It is the name accepted by a competent scientific body/authority, e.g. the United States Adopted Name (USAN) by the USAN council. Similarly, there is the British Approved name (BAN) of a drug. The non-proprietary names of newer drugs are kept uniform by an agreement to use the Recommended International Nonproprietary Name (rINN) in all member countries of the WHO. The BAN of older drugs as well has now been modified to be commensurate with rINN. However, many older drugs still have more than one non-proprietary names, e.g. \u2018meperidine\u2019 and \u2018pethidine\u2019 or \u2018lidocaine\u2019 and \u2018lignocaine\u2019 for the same drugs. Until the drug is included in a pharmacopoeia, the nonproprietary name may also be called the approved name. After its appearance in the official publication, it becomes the official name.\n\nIn common parlance, the term generic name is used in place of nonproprietary name. Etymologically this is incorrect: \u2018generic\u2019 should be applied to the chemical or pharmacological group (or genus) of the compound, e.g. phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, aminoglycoside antibiotics, etc. However, this misnomer is widely accepted and used even in official parlance.\n\n(c)Proprietary (Brand) name It is the name assigned by the manufacturer(s) and is his property or trade mark.

One drug may have multiple proprietary names, e.g. AMCARD, AMLOGARD, AMLOCOR, AMLONG, AMLOPIN, AMLOVAS, STAMLO for amlodipine from different manufacturers. Brand names are designed to be catchy, short, easy to remember and often suggestive, e.g. LOPRESOR suggesting drug for lowering blood pressure. Brand names generally differ in different countries, e.g. timolol maleate eye drops are marketed as TIMOPTIC in USA but as GLUCOMOL in India. Even the same manufacturer may market the same drug under different brand names in different countries. In addition, combined formulations have their own multiple brand names. This is responsible for much confusion in drug nomenclature.\n\nThere are many arguments for using the nonproprietary name in prescribing: uniformity, convenience, economy and better comprehension (propranolol, sotalol, timolol, pindolol, metoprolol, acebutolol, atenolol are all \u03b2 blockers, but their brand names have no such similarity). Drugs marketed under nonproprietary name (called generic products) are much cheaper than their branded counterparts, partly because the manufacturer invests a lot of money in promoting the brand name. However, when a drug is prescribed by the generic name, the chemist is free to dispense the generic product from any manufacturer, but not so when the drug is prescribed by a brand name. Thus, when it is important to ensure consistency of the product in terms of quality and bioavailability, etc. and especially when official control over quality of manufactured products is not rigorous, it is better to prescribe by the dependable brand name.\n\ndrug COMPENDIA\n\nThese are compilations of information on drugs in the form of monographs; without going into the theoretical concepts, mechanisms of action and other aspects which help in understanding the subject. Pharmacopoeias and Formularies are broughtout by the Government in a country, hold legal status and are called official compendia. In addition, some non-official compendia are published by professional bodies, which are supplementary and dependable sources of information about drugs.\n\nPharmacopoeias They contain description of chemical structure, molecular weight, physical and chemical characteristics, solubility, identification and assay methods, standards of purity, storage conditions and dosage forms of officially approved drugs in a country. They are useful to drug manufacturers and regulatory authorities, but not to doctors, most of whom never see a pharmacopoeia. Examples are Indian (IP), British (BP), European (Eur P), United States (USP) pharmacopoeias.\n\nFormularies Generally produced in easily carried booklet form, they list indications, dose, dosage forms, contraindications, precautions, adverse effects and storage of selected drugs that are available for medicinal use in a country. Drugs are categorized by their therapeutic class. Some rational fixed-dose drug combinations are included. A brief commentary on the drug class and clinical conditions in which they are used generally precedes specifics of individual drugs. Brief guidelines for treatment of selected conditions are provided. While British National Formulary (BNF) also lists brand names with costs, the National Formulary of India (NFI) does not include these. Most formularies have informative appendices as well. Formularies can be considerably helpful to prescribers. \n\nMartindale: The Complete Drug Reference (Extrapharmacopoeia) Published every 2\u20133 years by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, this non-official compendium is an exhaustive and updated compilation of unbiased information on medicines used/registered all over the world.

Essential medicines are intended to be available within the context of functioning health systems at all times and in adequate amounts, in appropriate dosage forms, with assured quality and adequate information, and at a price the individual and the community can afford.\n\nIt has been realized that only a handful of medicines out of the multitude available can meet the health care needs of majority of the people in any country, and that many well tested and cheaper medicines are equally (or more) efficacious and safe as their newer more expensive congeners. For optimum utilization of resources, governments (especially in developing countries) should concentrate on these medicines by identifying them as Essential medicines. The WHO has laid down criteria to guide selection of an essential medicine.*\n\n(a) Adequate data on its efficacy and safety should be available from clinical studies.\n\n(b) It should be available in a form in which quality, including bioavailability, and stability on storage can be assured.\n\n(c) Its choice should depend upon pattern of prevalent diseases; availability of facilities and trained personnel; financial resources; genetic, demographic and environmental factors.\n\n(d) In case of two or more similar medicines, choice should be made on the basis of their relative efficacy, safety, quality, price and availability. Cost-benefit ratio should be a major consideration.\n\n(e) Choice may also be influenced by comparative pharmacokinetic properties and local facilities for manufacture and storage.\n\n(f) Most essential medicines should be single compounds. Fixed ratio combination products should be included only when dosage of each ingredient meets the requirements of a defined population group, and when the combination has a proven advantage in therapeutic effect, safety, adherence or in decreasing the emergence of drug resistance.\n\n(g) Selection of essential medicines should be a continuous process which should take into account the changing priorities for public health action, epidemiological conditions as well as availability of better medicines/formulations and progress in pharmacological knowledge.\n\n(h)Recently, it has been emphasized to select essential medicines based on rationally developed treatment guidelines.\n\nTo guide the member countries, the WHO brought out its first Model List of Essential Drugs along with their dosage forms and strengths in 1977 which could be adopted after suitable modifications according to local needs. This has been revised from time to time and the current is the 20th list (2017)$ which has 433 medicines, including 25 fixed dose drug combinations (FDCs). India produced its National Essential Drugs List in 1996, and has revised it in 2011, and now in 2015 with the title \u201cNational List of Essential Medicines\u201d.\u00a3 The latest list includes 376 medicines, of which 20 are FDCs. These medicines have been marked into 3 categories for being available at primary, secondary and tertiary levels of health care facility. \n\nAdoption of the essential medicines list for procurement and supply of medicines, especially in the public sector healthcare system, has resulted in improved availability of medicines, cost saving and more rational use of drugs.\n\n*The use of Essential Drugs (including the 8th model list of essential drugs); WHO Technical report series 850, 1995, Geneva.\n\n$www.who.int>20th\u2014essential med-list (pub. 6 Jun 2017).\n\n\u00a3National list of Essential Medicines (2015) [http//www.cdsco.nic.in]\n\nPrescription and non-prescription drugs\n\nAs per drug rules, majority of drugs including all antibiotics must be sold in retail only against a prescription issued to a patient by a registered medical practitioner.

Every active ingredient (drug) has to be formulated by adding other substances (excipients, diluents, preservatives, vehicles, etc.) according to a specific recipe and packaged into a specific \u2018dosage form\u2019 such as tablet, elixir, ointment, injection vial, etc. which is then administered to the subject. The dosage form provides body to the drug, demarkates single doses, protects the active ingredient(s), and makes it suitable for administration in various ways. The important dosage forms are briefly described below.\n\nSolid dosage forms\n\n1.Powders The drug is in a dry and finely pulverised state. If the drug is for oral administration, each dose has to be wrapped separately or packed in sachets; therefore this dosage form is inconvenient and unpopular except when the quantity is several grams, e.g. oral rehydration salts. Powders for topical application (dusting powders) are supplied as bulk powders in metallic or plastic containers with holes for sprinkling. Effervescent powders contain granulated sod. bicarbonate and citric or tartaric acid. They react when dissolved in water to liberate CO2 causing bubbling.\n\n2.Tablets The drug is powdered or granulated, mixed with binding agents, and other excipients, and compressed/moulded into discoid, oblong or other shapes suitable for swallowing. The tablet may be plain or sugar coated or film coated. Other specialized types of tablets are:\n\nChewable tablets\u2014can be chewed and swallowed, ingredients must be pleasent tasting.\n\nDispersible tablets\u2014the tablet is dropped in a small quantity of water, wherein it disperses quickly; the solution is then gulped.\n\nSublingual tablets\u2014put under the tongue, the drug is rapidly absorbed from the mouth.\n\nEnteric coated tablet\u2014the tablet is coated with a material that does not dissolve in the acidic medium of the stomach; the tablet disintegrates only on reaching the duodenum.\n\nSustained/Extended release tablets\u2014These contain drug particles which are coated to dissolve at different rates. The active ingredient is made available for absorption over a longer period of time. The duration of action of short acting (2-6 hours) drugs can be extended to 12 hours or more.", "start_char_idx": 21933, "end_char_idx": 26197, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "111e4025-f1b6-4c6c-975f-c5f73b43d150": {"__data__": {"id_": "111e4025-f1b6-4c6c-975f-c5f73b43d150", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "chapter_1.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/chapter_1.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 24636, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "39b7f7f7-90a5-498a-8ef5-189c50d3cc52", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "chapter_1.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/chapter_1.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 24636, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "3d30339e395da8894d69360f3f14a03c15dc3d209a0f1b2a2552ca03554b9b04", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5c592e6d-aaa1-4a2b-aaf0-98dc81e12c2d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "chapter_1.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/chapter_1.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 24636, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "d5469a8624243c8e9a1bf4dced5811c47ddfefe9ebca30fec71209209820ec60", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "dbe72e26-b158-4e5f-b39c-25ccdc89bb21", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1023d8f1eb57e982ebf023cb9ded56a6d50b47b157f590f109f6f00d625bfdb3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The tablet may be plain or sugar coated or film coated.

This is then rolled into spherical/oval bodies meant to be swallowed. The term is often loosely applied to tablets as well.\n\n4.Capsules These are water soluble cylindrical containers made of gelatin which are filled with powdered or liquid medicament. The container dissolves on swallowing so that the drug is released in the stomach. Soft gelatine capsules dissolve very rapidly and generally contain liquid medicament. Enteric coated capsules are designed to dissolve only on reaching the ileum. Spansules are extended release capsules which are packed with granules of the drug having different coatings to dissolve over a range of time periods.\n\n5.Lozenges These are tablet-like bodies of various shapes containing the drug along with a suitable gum, sweetening and flavouring agents. They are to be retained in the mouth and allowed to dissolve slowly, providing the drug for local action in the mouth and throat.\n\n6.Suppositories These are conical bullet- shaped dosage forms for insertion into the anal canal, in which the drug is mixed with a mouldable firm base that melts at body temperature and releases the contained drug. Oval or suitably shaped bodies for vaginal insertion are called \u2018pessaries\u2019, while elongated pencil-like cones meant for insertion into male or female urethra are called bougies.\n\nLiquid dosage forms\n\n1.Aqueous solutions They contain the drug dissolved in water, and may be meant for oral, topical or parenteral administration. Oral drug solutions often contain sweetening and flavouring agents. Preservatives have to be mostly added because shelf-life of watery solutions is short.\n\n2.Suspensions are dispersion of insoluble drugs in water with the help of a suspending agent. Emulsions are uniform mixtures of two immiscible liquids (mostly oil and water) in which droplets of one (dispersed phase) are suspended in the other (continuous phase) with the help of an amphiphilic emulsifying agent. Milk is a naturally occurring emulsion. Both suspensions and emulsions tend to settle down on keeping; should be shaken thoroughly before use.\n\n3.Elixirs are hydro-alcoholic solutions of drugs, usually sweetened with syrup and flavoured by fruit extracts. Syrups have higher concentration of sugar and are thicker in consistency. Drugs that deteriorate in aqueous medium can be dispensed as \u2018dry syrups\u2019 which is reconstituted by adding water and shaking. The reconstituted syrup must be used within a few days. Linctus is a viscous syrupy liquid meant to be licked slowly for soothing the throat. It generally has menthol to impart cooling sensation, and an antitussive.\n\n4.Drops These are relatively more concentrated solutions of medicaments meant for oral ingestion or external application to eye, nose or ear canal. Oral drops are the preferred dosage form for infants and young children. Eye/nasal drops should be isotonic. Eye drops need sterilization. Drops are supplied in vials with a nozzle or alongwith a dropper for accurate dosing.\n\n5.Lotions These are solutions, suspensions or emulsions meant for external application to the skin without rubbing. They generally have soothing, cooling, protective or emollient property and are better suited than creams or ointments for hairy skin. Liniments are similar preparations which generally contain counterirritants, and are to be rubbed on the skin to relieve pain and cause rubefaction.\n\n6.Injections These are sterile solutions or suspensions in aqueous or oily medium for subcutaneous or intramuscular administration.", "start_char_idx": 25329, "end_char_idx": 29947, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dbe72e26-b158-4e5f-b39c-25ccdc89bb21": {"__data__": {"id_": "dbe72e26-b158-4e5f-b39c-25ccdc89bb21", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "chapter_1.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/chapter_1.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 24636, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "39b7f7f7-90a5-498a-8ef5-189c50d3cc52", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "chapter_1.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/chapter_1.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 24636, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "3d30339e395da8894d69360f3f14a03c15dc3d209a0f1b2a2552ca03554b9b04", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "111e4025-f1b6-4c6c-975f-c5f73b43d150", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "chapter_1.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/chapter_1.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 24636, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "f5aaa0b88c3f795abe4fa13165ef6e51b91ba765cf0b85e4edd00ac7a4932224", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1c4aaf60-f5ed-4fb1-8983-3189e8b46a02", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "035b064cff50c5edbc5afae89be41820ddcda99469820cc938c02faacd65c2a3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "4.Drops These are relatively more concentrated solutions of medicaments meant for oral ingestion or external application to eye, nose or ear canal.

Liniments are similar preparations which generally contain counterirritants, and are to be rubbed on the skin to relieve pain and cause rubefaction.\n\n6.Injections These are sterile solutions or suspensions in aqueous or oily medium for subcutaneous or intramuscular administration. Only aqueous solutions (not suspensions) are suitable for intravenous (i.v.) injection, because particles in suspension and oils injected i.v. can cause embolism. Injections are supplied in sealed glass ampoules or air tight rubber capped vials. Ampoules are broken just before injection, and usually contain a single dose. Drug from the vial is sucked in a syringe by piercing the rubber cap. Vials may be single or multi-dose. Drugs which are unstable in solution are supplied as dry powder vials. Sterile solvent is injected in the vial just before it is to be administered, and the dissolved/suspended drug is then sucked out into the syringe. Some drugs like insulin are also supplied in prefilled syringes and pen injectors. Large volume i.v. infusions are marketed in glass/polypropylene bottles.\n\nSemisolid dosage forms\n\n1.Ointments These are greasy semisolid preparations meant for external application to the skin, eye, nasal mucosa, ear or anal canal. The drug is incorporated in an oily base, such as soft or hard paraffin, wool fat, bee\u2019s wax, etc. Ointments are not suitable for oozing surfaces, because they are more occlusive and donot allow evaporation of water. Rather they are good for dry, chronic lesions. Creams are similar to ointment but the base is a water in oil emulsion. The medicament is better absorbed into the skin from creams than from ointments, and creams are cosmetically more acceptable than ointments.\n\n2.Pastes These are nongreasy preparations of thick consistency containing hydrophilic adhesive powders such as starch, prepared chalk, aluminium/magnesium hydroxide, zinc oxide, carboxy methylcellulose, etc. which swell by absorbing water. Pastes may contain viscous nonoily liquids like glycerol or propylene glycol. Pastes can be applied to inflamed or excoriated skin, oozing surfaces and mucous membranes. Toothpastes are items of personal hygiene, and medicated toothpastes are extensively used in dentistry.\n\n3.Gels The medicament is incorporated in a viscous colloidal solution of gelatin or similar material and is usually dispensed in collapsible tubes. They are meant for external application to the skin or mucosa and provide longer duration contact, but are nongreasy and washable with water. Gels are suitable for application to hairy skin, and are commonly applied to oral ulcers because they are better retained than aqueous solutions.\n\nInhalations\n\nDrugs which are gases or volatile liquids can be administered by inhalation carried into air or oxygen with the help of a mouth piece, face mask, hood or endotracheal tube. Nonvolatile liquids and fine particle solids can be aerosolized using a metered dose inhaler, jet nebulizer, rotahaler or spinhaler for inhalation through the mouth. Pressurized metered dose inhalers (PMDIs) are hand-held devices which use a propellant, mostly hydrofluoroalkane (HFA), and deliver a specified dose of the drug in aerosol form per actuation. Jet nebulizers produce a mist of the drug solution generated by pressurized air or oxygen. Rotahaler is also a portable device in which a capsule (rotacap) containing very fine powder of the drug is punctured during actuation and the released particles are aerosolized by the inspiratory airflow of the patient.

Thus, high concentrations are attained at the desired site without exposing the rest of the body. Systemic side effects or toxicity are consequently absent or minimal. For drugs (in suitable dosage forms) that are absorbed from these sites/routes, the same can serve as systemic route of administration, e.g. glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) applied on the skin as ointment or transdermal patch for angina pectoris. The local routes are:\n\n1.Topical This refers to external application of the drug to the surface for localized action. It is often more convenient as well as reassuring to the patient. Drugs can be efficiently delivered to the localized lesions on skin, oropharyngeal/ nasal mucosa, eyes, ear canal, anal canal or vagina in the form of lotion, ointment, cream, powder, rinse, paints, drops, spray, lozengens, suppositories or pesseries. Nonabsorbable drugs given orally for action on g.i. mucosa (sucralfate, vancomycin), inhalation of drugs for action on bronchi (salbutamol, cromolyn sodium) and irrigating solutions/jellys (povidone iodine, lidocaine) applied to urethra are other forms of topical medication.\n\n2.Deeper tissues Certain deep areas can be approached by using a syringe and needle, but the drug should be in such a form that systemic absorption is slow, e.g. intra-articular injection (hydrocortisone acetate in knee joint), infiltration around a nerve or intrathecal injection (lidocaine), retrobulbar injection (hydrocortisone acetate behind the eyeball).\n\n3.Arterial supply Close intra-arterial injection is used for contrast media in angiography; anticancer drugs can be infused in femoral or brachial artery to localise the effect for limb malignancies.\n\nSYSTEMIC ROUTES\n\nThe drug administered through systemic routes is intended to be absorbed into the blood stream and distributed all over, including the site of action, through circulation (see Fig. 1.1).\n\n1.Oral\n\nOral ingestion is the oldest and commonest mode of drug administration. It is safer, more convenient, does not need assistance, noninvasive, often painless, the medicament need not be sterile and so is cheaper. Both solid dosage forms (powders, tablets, capsules, spansules, dragees, moulded tablets, gastrointestinal therapeutic systems\u2014GITs) and liquid dosage forms (elixirs, syrups, emulsions, mixtures) can be given orally.\n\nLimitations of oral route of administration\n\n\n\n\u2022Action of drugs is slower and thus not suitable for emergencies.\n\n\u2022Unpalatable drugs (chloramphenicol) are difficult to administer; drug may be filled in capsules to circumvent this.\n\n\u2022May cause nausea and vomiting.\n\n\u2022Cannot be used for uncooperative/unconscious/vomiting patient.\n\n\u2022Absorption of the drug may be variable and erratic; certain drugs are not absorbed (streptomycin).\n\n\u2022Others are destroyed by digestive juices (penicillin G, insulin) or in liver (GTN, testosterone, lidocaine).\n\n2.Sublingual (s.l.) or buccal\n\nThe tablet or pellet containing the drug is placed under the tongue or crushed in the mouth and spread over the buccal mucosa. Only lipid soluble and non-irritating drugs can be so administered. Absorption is relatively rapid\u2014action can be produced in minutes. Though it is somewhat inconvenient, one can spit the drug after the desired effect has been obtained. The chief advantage is that liver is bypassed and drugs with high first pass metabolism can be absorbed directly into systemic circulation.", "start_char_idx": 33593, "end_char_idx": 38053, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6a640252-70c1-4da4-ac34-2ef82e179834": {"__data__": {"id_": "6a640252-70c1-4da4-ac34-2ef82e179834", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "chapter_1.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/chapter_1.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 24636, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "39b7f7f7-90a5-498a-8ef5-189c50d3cc52", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "chapter_1.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/chapter_1.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 24636, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "3d30339e395da8894d69360f3f14a03c15dc3d209a0f1b2a2552ca03554b9b04", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e41f92b9-2223-44bb-8fc5-dbbdb2716107", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "chapter_1.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/chapter_1.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 24636, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "a340b82ed04159f4c191c91b4c8245ba693667641d9aa4e4ed828edb1ab2d97e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "aba2f94b-ee14-4460-aefe-cfa8f5b3a4f6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cf7c2cbd562ef843f05449881667a3586fbb522fdf42e3afa538374562ad4bbc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "\u2022May cause nausea and vomiting.\n\n\u2022Cannot be used for uncooperative/unconscious/vomiting patient.\n\n\u2022Absorption of the drug may be variable and erratic; certain drugs are not absorbed (streptomycin).\n\n\u2022Others are destroyed by digestive juices (penicillin G, insulin) or in liver (GTN, testosterone, lidocaine).\n\n2.Sublingual (s.l.) or buccal\n\nThe tablet or pellet containing the drug is placed under the tongue or crushed in the mouth and spread over the buccal mucosa.

The chief advantage is that liver is bypassed and drugs with high first pass metabolism can be absorbed directly into systemic circulation. Drugs given sublingually are\u2014GTN, buprenorphine, desamino-oxytocin.\n\n3.Rectal\n\nCertain irritant and unpleasant drugs can be put into rectum as suppositories or retention enema for systemic effect. This route can also be used when the patient is having recurrent vomiting or is unconscious. However, it is rather inconvenient and embarrassing; absorption is slower, irregular and often unpredictable, though diazepam solution and paracetamol suppository are rapidly and dependably absorbed from the rectum in children. Drug absorbed into external haemorrhoidal veins (about 50%) bypasses liver, but not that absorbed into internal haemorrhoidal veins. Rectal inflammation can result from irritant drugs. Diazepam, indomethacin, paracetamol, ergotamine and few other drugs are some times given rectally.\n\n4.Cutaneous\n\nHighly lipid soluble drugs can be applied over the skin for slow and prolonged absorption. The liver is also bypassed. The drug can be incorporated in an ointment and applied over specified area of skin. Absorption of the drug can be enhanced by rubbing the preparation, by using an oily base and by an occlusive dressing.\n\nTransdermal therapeutic systems (TTS) These are devices in the form of adhesive patches of various shapes and sizes (5\u201320 cm2) which deliver the contained drug at a constant rate into systemic circulation via the stratum corneum (Fig. 1.2). The drug (in solution or bound to a polymer) is held in a reservoir between an occlusive backing film and a rate controlling micropore membrane, the under surface of which is smeared with an adhesive impregnated with priming dose of the drug. The adhesive layer is protected by another film that is to be peeled off just before application. The drug is delivered at the skin surface by diffusion for percutaneous absorption into circulation. The micropore membrane is such that rate of drug delivery to skin surface is less than the slowest rate of absorption from the skin. This offsets any variation in the rate of absorption according to the properties of different sites. As such, the drug is delivered at a constant and predictable rate irrespective of site of application. Usually chest, abdomen, upper arm, lower back, buttock or mastoid region are utilized.\n\nTransdermal patches of GTN, fentanyl, nicotine and estradiol are available in India, while those of isosorbide dinitrate, hyoscine, and clonidine are marketed elsewhere. For different drugs, TTS have been designed to last for 1\u20133 days. Though more expensive, they provide smooth plasma concentrations of the drug without fluctuations; minimize interindividual variations (drug is subjected to little first pass metabolism) and side effects. They are also more convenient\u2014many patients prefer transdermal patches to oral tablets of the same drug; patient compliance is better. Local irritation and erythema occurs in some subjects, but is generally mild; can be minimized by changing the site of application each time by rotation. Discontinuation has been necessary in only 2\u20137% cases.\n\n5.Inhalation\n\nVolatile liquids and gases are given by inhalation for systemic action, e.g. general anaesthetics.

Local irritation and erythema occurs in some subjects, but is generally mild; can be minimized by changing the site of application each time by rotation. Discontinuation has been necessary in only 2\u20137% cases.\n\n5.Inhalation\n\nVolatile liquids and gases are given by inhalation for systemic action, e.g. general anaesthetics. Absorption takes place from the vast surface of alveoli\u2014action is very rapid. When administration is discontinued the drug diffuses back and is rapidly eliminated in expired air. Thus, controlled administration is possible with moment to moment adjustment. Irritant vapours (ether) cause inflammation of respiratory tract and increase secretion.\n\n6.Nasal\n\nThe mucous membrane of the nose can readily absorb many drugs; digestive juices and liver are bypassed. However, only certain drugs like GnRH agonists, calcitonin and desmopressin applied as a spray or nebulized solution have been used by this route. This route is being tried for some other peptide drugs like insulin, as well as to bypass the blood-brain barrier.\n\n7.Parenteral\n\n(Par\u2014beyond, enteral\u2014intestinal)\n\nConventionally, parenteral refers to administration by injection which takes the drug directly into the tissue fluid or blood without having to cross the enteral mucosa. The limitations of oral administration are circumvented.\n\nDrug action is faster and surer (valuable in emergencies). Gastric irritation and vomiting are not provoked. Parenteral routes can be employed even in unconscious, uncooperative or vomiting patient. There are no chances of interference by food or digestive juices. Liver is bypassed.\n\nDisadvantages of parenteral routes are\u2014the preparation has to be sterilized and is costlier, the technique is invasive and painful, assistance of another person is mostly needed (though self injection is possible, e.g. insulin by diabetics), there are chances of local tissue injury and, in general, parenteral route is more risky than oral. The important parenteral routes are:\n\n(i) Subcutaneous (s.c.) The drug is deposited in the loose subcutaneous tissue which is richly supplied by nerves (irritant drugs cannot be injected) but is less vascular (absorption is slower than intramuscular). Only small volumes can be injected s.c. Self-injection is possible because deep penetration is not needed. This route should be avoided in shock patients who are vasoconstricted\u2014absorption will be delayed. Repository (depot) preparations that are aqueous suspensions can be injected for prolonged action. Some special forms of this route are:\n\n(a) Dermojet In this method needle is not used; a high velocity jet of drug solution is projected from a microfine orifice using a gun like implement. The solution passes through the superficial layers and gets deposited in the subcutaneous tissue. It is essentially painless and suited for mass inoculations.\n\n(b) Pellet implantation The drug in the form of a solid pellet is introduced with a trochar and cannula. This provides sustained release of the drug over weeks and months, e.g. DOCA, testosterone.\n\n(c)Sialistic (nonbiodegradable) and biodegradable implants Crystalline drug is packed in tubes or capsules made of suitable materials and implanted under the skin. Slow and uniform leaching of the drug occurs over months providing constant blood levels. The nonbiodegradable implant has to be removed later on but not the biodegradable one. This has been tried for hormones and contraceptives (e.g. NORPLANT).\n\n(ii) Intramuscular (i.m.) The drug is injected in one of the large skeletal muscles\u2014deltoid, triceps, gluteus maximus, rectus femoris, etc. Muscle is less richly supplied with sensory nerves (mild irritants can be injected) and is more vascular (absorption of drugs in aqueous solution is faster). It is less painful, but self injection is often impracticable because deep penetration is needed. Depot preparations (oily solutions, aqueous suspensions) can be injected by this route. Intramuscular injections should be avoided in anticoagulant treated patients, because it can produce local haematoma.\n\n(iii) Intravenous (i.v.) The drug is injected as a bolus (Greek: bolos\u2013lump) or infused slowly over hours in one of the superficial veins. The drug reaches directly into the blood stream and effects are produced immediately (great value in emergency).", "start_char_idx": 40743, "end_char_idx": 45197, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "987acdee-9878-4e56-bc89-2be12836a3da": {"__data__": {"id_": "987acdee-9878-4e56-bc89-2be12836a3da", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_name": "chapter_1.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/chapter_1.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 24636, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "39b7f7f7-90a5-498a-8ef5-189c50d3cc52", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_name": "chapter_1.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/chapter_1.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 24636, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "3d30339e395da8894d69360f3f14a03c15dc3d209a0f1b2a2552ca03554b9b04", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "aba2f94b-ee14-4460-aefe-cfa8f5b3a4f6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_name": "chapter_1.docx", "file_path": "/content/drive/MyDrive/Epub/Epub_5_chap/chapter_1.docx", "file_type": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "file_size": 24636, "creation_date": "2024-03-27", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-27"}, "hash": "de238a0bb423f63802f040e0584fdaac5c7fc551b74d058acf734ce32f74a79e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The drug is injected in one of the large skeletal muscles\u2014deltoid, triceps, gluteus maximus, rectus femoris, etc. Muscle is less richly supplied with sensory nerves (mild irritants can be injected) and is more vascular (absorption of drugs in aqueous solution is faster).

The drug is injected as a bolus (Greek: bolos\u2013lump) or infused slowly over hours in one of the superficial veins.

The intima of veins is insensitive and drug gets diluted with blood, therefore, even highly irritant drugs can be injected i.v., but hazards are\u2014thrombophlebitis of the injected vein and necrosis of adjoining tissues if extravasation occurs. These complications can be minimized by diluting the drug or injecting it into a running i.v. line. Only aqueous solutions (not suspensions, because drug particles can cause embolism) are to be injected i.v. and there are no depot preparations for this route. Chances of causing air embolism is another risk. The dose of the drug required is smallest (bioavailability is 100%) and even large volumes can be infused. One big advantage with this route is\u2014in case response is accurately measurable (e.g. BP) and the drug short acting (e.g. sodium nitroprusside), titration of the dose with the response is possible. However, this is the most risky route\u2014vital organs like heart, brain, etc. get exposed to high concentrations of the drug.\n\n(iv) Intradermal injection The drug is injected into the skin raising a bleb (e.g. BCG vaccine, sensitivity testing) or scarring/multiple puncture of the epidermis through a drop of the drug is done.
