Abstract
Recent research, such as BitNet [ WMD+23], is paving the way for a new era of 1-
bit Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we introduce a 1-bit LLM variant,
namely BitNet b1.58 , in which every single parameter (or weight) of the LLM is
ternary {-1, 0, 1}. It matches the full-precision (i.e., FP16 or BF16) Transformer
LLM with the same model size and training tokens in terms of both perplexity
and end-task performance, while being significantly more cost-effective in terms
of latency, memory, throughput, and energy consumption. More profoundly, the
1.58-bit LLM defines a new scaling law and recipe for training new generations of
LLMs that are both high-performance and cost-effective. Furthermore, it enables
a new computation paradigm and opens the door for designing specific hardware
optimized for 1-bit LLMs.

Figure 1: 1-bit LLMs (e.g., BitNet b1.58 ) provide a Pareto solution to reduce inference cost (latency,
throughput, and energy) of LLMs while maintaining model performance. The new computation
paradigm of BitNet b1.58 calls for actions to design new hardware optimized for 1-bit LLMs.
